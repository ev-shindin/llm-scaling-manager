##@ Install, in three phases

# SCOPE picks what the controller manages. NAMESPACE scope is the default because
# it is the common case — one team, one namespace, and the only shape a namespace
# admin can own. `SCOPE=cluster` gives one controller for every namespace.
#
# Only the make targets default this way; deploy/install.sh keeps its historical
# platform default for anything calling it directly (the e2e does).
SCOPE ?= $(if $(WVA_SCOPE),$(WVA_SCOPE),namespace)

# The phases split where the PERMISSIONS split, so a namespace admin can own the
# controller without holding cluster-scoped rights:
#
#   1. check-prereqs                 read-only. Renders the overlay this install
#                                    would apply, asks whether you may create each
#                                    kind in it, and reports the namespace and
#                                    Prometheus it resolved.
#   2. setup-prereqs                 CLUSTER ADMIN, once per namespace: the
#                                    namespace, cluster-scoped RBAC, the
#                                    ServiceMonitor, and Prometheus / KEDA if the
#                                    cluster has none.
#
# Phases 1 and 2 take the platform as ENVIRONMENT=kubernetes|openshift; only
# phase 3 also has -on-k8s / -on-openshift spellings. This block used to write
# all three as <phase>-on-<platform>, naming two targets that do not exist.
#   3. deploy-wva-on-<platform>      everything (the default). Set
#                                    INSTALL_PHASE=wva for the controller alone,
#                                    which is what a namespace owner runs once an
#                                    admin has done phase 2.

	@# CLUSTER-scoped, deliberately, even though the controller now lives with the
	@# models. smoke_keda_test.go and limiter_test.go create ISOLATED NAMESPACES at
	@# runtime, and a namespace-scoped controller cannot serve a ScaledObject in a
	@# namespace that did not exist when it was installed -- KEDA reported the
	@# ScaledObject Ready=False in smoke-keda-basic-fjr5d because nothing watched it.
	@# kind used to INFER cluster scope; #24 made namespace the default everywhere and
	@# nothing here said otherwise. Aligning WVA_NS with the model namespace stays:
	@# it is the SCOPE that has to be cluster, not the controller's location.
	@# Installed through `make deploy-wva` -- the target a USER runs -- not by
	@# calling deploy/install.sh with a hand-assembled environment.
	@#
	@# The suite shared the script but not the invocation, so it never passed
	@# WVA_SCOPE, NAMESPACE, WVA_LIMITER or INSTALL_PHASE. When the scope
	@# default changed from platform-inferred to `namespace`, the e2e silently
	@# changed shape and nothing in the suite covered the path users take: a
	@# change to install semantics could land green here and break `make
	@# deploy-wva`. Now the same macro serves both.
	@#
	@# WVA_NS and NAMESPACE are both PINNED. The suite puts model servers in
	@# LLMD_NAMESPACE and the controller in CONTROLLER_NAMESPACE, so the namespace
	@# WVA MANAGES has to be named -- that is what WVA_WATCH_NS is for, and
	@# wva_apply_watch_namespace_rbac renders the manager Role into it.
	@#
	@# Aligning them beats reaching for cluster scope: namespace scope is the
	@# supported shape, cluster scope now warns that it is WIP, and the suite
	@# should exercise what users run. Unset, the install watched only its own
	@# namespace and took namespace-scoped RBAC with it:
	@#   scaledobjects.keda.sh "stz-rt-so" is forbidden
	@#   Could not read the ScaledObject for a registered workload
	@# so the workload was never enriched and never parked.
	@#
	@# WVA_NS is PINNED. Without it the install lands wherever namespace discovery
	@# points, and the suite builds scalerAddress from CONTROLLER_NAMESPACE -- so a
	@# controller that moves is one KEDA can never reach.
	@#
	@# It moved when the scope default changed: wva_autoselect_namespace runs only
	@# in NAMESPACE scope, which used to be inferred as `cluster` on kind, so it was
	@# skipped. Now that namespace is the default everywhere it runs, finds the one
	@# namespace with model servers (llm-d-sim) and installs the controller there.
	@# Measured: the controller came up in llm-d-sim while every ScaledObject named
	@# wva-external-scaler.workload-variant-autoscaler-system, so no decision ever
	@# reached KEDA and four specs sat at one replica for their full 600s.
