# Workload-Variant-Autoscaler documentation

The scaling manager decides how many replicas of each model variant should run, and drives KEDA
to make it so. It reads what your inference engines are doing, computes a target
per model each cycle, and answers KEDA's external scaler with it.

Three words, used throughout: a **model** is what a client asks for by name; a
**variant** is one way of serving it — concretely one KEDA ScaledObject and the
workload it scales, which is the unit the scaling manager decides for; a **replica** is one Pod
of a variant. Variants whose triggers name the same `modelID` are variants of
one model, and are scaled as a group.

## Well-lit paths — start from the problem

Documented, tested and benchmarked recipes. Each page names the suites and the
benchmark scenario behind it, and says which leg is short when one is.

| Path | For |
| --- | --- |
| [Scale a model on saturation](well-lit-paths/scale-on-saturation/) | the default: replica counts that follow real serving load |
| [Scale to zero, and get back](well-lit-paths/scale-to-zero/) | releasing an idle model's accelerators, and waking it |
| [Bridge a scale-up with a warm pool](well-lit-paths/warm-pool-bridge/) | spikes that arrive faster than a replica loads |
| [Hold several large models on one set of GPUs](well-lit-paths/retained-pool/) | more large models than hardware to run them — **experimental** |
| [Bound a fleet by real GPUs](well-lit-paths/bound-by-gpus/) | a shared cluster where `maxReplicaCount` is not a real ceiling |
| [Cap what each tenant may take](well-lit-paths/tenant-gpu-quotas/) | per-namespace or cluster-wide GPU allowances |
| [Bound tenants by the quotas Kueue already holds](well-lit-paths/kueue-bounded-quotas/) | the allowance is Kueue's nominal quota, followed live — **experimental** |
| [Different behaviour per workload class](well-lit-paths/workload-classes/) | interactive and batch, tuned as classes rather than per model |
| [One model, two accelerator variants](well-lit-paths/accelerator-variants/) | letting the optimizer pick the cost-efficient hardware |
| [A P/D-disaggregated model](well-lit-paths/pd-disaggregation/) | prefill and decode scaled apart — **experimental** |

## Guides — the steps

Every guide runs one task from nothing to working, in the same shape: *Overview →
Prerequisites → Installation → Verification → Cleanup → Configuration*. The
commands are generated from each guide's `guide.yaml`, so they cannot drift from
what they document. Index and conventions: **[guides/](guides/)**.

**Installing** — [in a namespace](guides/install-in-namespace/) (the common
case) · [cluster-wide](guides/install-cluster-wide/) · [a small llm-d model
first](guides/install-small-model/), if nothing is serving yet

**Administering** — [cluster-admin setup for a
namespace](guides/admin-cluster-setup/) · [bound every install by real
GPUs](guides/admin-gpu-bounding/)

**Exercising** — [scale to zero](guides/scale-to-zero/) · [warm
pool](guides/warm-pool/) · [test against a full llm-d
stack](guides/testing-with-llm-d/) · [benchmark the scaling manager](guides/benchmarking/)

- **[Watching what the scaling manager decides](reference/monitoring.md)** — the dashboard, who owns it, and the metrics that answer specific questions
- **[The cycle log](reference/cycle-log.md)** — the two lines the scaling manager emits per cycle, their fields and reason codes: the page that answers "why did it scale?"
- **[Scaling policy](reference/scaling-policy.md)** — thresholds, tiers, scale-to-zero, limiters, the utilization-share optimizer

- **[Metrics and health](reference/metrics.md)** · **[Prometheus integration](reference/prometheus.md)**
- **[Router configuration](reference/router-configuration.md)** — the two router settings that decide what the scaling manager sees: flow control bounds the queue it reads as demand, and the scheduling profiles decide whether the replicas it orders get used
- **[SGLang backend](reference/sglang-backend.md)** — auto-detected per variant; nothing to configure
- **[Troubleshooting](reference/troubleshooting.md)**
