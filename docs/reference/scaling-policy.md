# Saturation Scaling Configuration

## Overview

llm-scaling-manager supports saturation-based scaling using KV cache utilization and queue length metrics. This feature is enabled by default and configured via a ConfigMap.

**Key features:**
- ✅ ConfigMap-based configuration with global defaults and per-model overrides
- ✅ **Efficient caching** with single read on startup (zero API calls during reconciliation)
- ✅ **Automatic reload** via ConfigMap watch (immediate response to changes)
- ✅ **Thread-safe** concurrent access with RWMutex
- ✅ Graceful degradation if ConfigMap missing (the analyzer has hardcoded defaults — see [Default Configuration](#default-configuration))

## Analyzer Selection

There is one saturation analyzer: the token/capacity-based analyzer. The V1
percentage/spare-capacity analyzer was removed, so `analyzerName` and the
`analyzers:` list no longer select between engines — see the note on
`analyzerName` in `internal/config/saturation_scaling.go`.

### Threshold ownership

What each threshold controls:

| Threshold | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| `kvCacheThreshold` | Ceiling on usable KV: capacity is the physical budget scaled by this (default 0.80) |
| `queueLengthThreshold` | Queue depth at which the compute-bound capacity estimate is taken |
| `scaleUpThreshold` | Utilization above which scale-up triggers — engine post-step (default 0.85) |
| `scaleDownBoundary` | Utilization below which scale-down is safe — engine post-step (default 0.70) |

## ScalingPolicy Schema (Phase 1)

Phase 1 of the [ScalingPolicy proposal](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-workload-variant-autoscaler/pull/1245)
extends this ConfigMap — additively, with no CRD, migration, or new install steps —
with a plugin envelope on each entry. Existing flat entries keep working unchanged;
adoption is optional per entry.

### Analyzer plugin envelope (`type` / `parameters`)

Each `analyzers:` entry accepts a `type` and a free-form `parameters` map:

```yaml
analyzers:
  - type: saturation
    parameters: { scaleUpThreshold: 0.95 }
```

- `type` selects the analyzer plugin (`saturation`, `queueing-model`, `throughput`).
  It falls back to `name` when omitted, so the legacy `- name: saturation` form still
  works and is treated as `type: saturation`.
- `parameters` carries plugin configuration. The well-known keys `scaleUpThreshold`,
  `scaleDownBoundary`, `score`, and `enabled` are equivalent to the corresponding
  top-level/typed fields (an explicit typed field wins over the same key in
  `parameters`). Unknown keys are tolerated (forward-compatible); a wrongly-typed
  known key fails validation and the entry is skipped.

There is nothing to opt out to: the token/capacity-based analyzer runs whether or
not `analyzers:` is set — see [Analyzer Selection](#analyzer-selection).

### `scaleToZero`

An entry carries the whole scale-to-zero policy, and is the only per-model surface
for it:

```yaml
scaleToZero:
  enabled: false
  retentionPeriod: 5m
```

| field | absent means | ends at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | inherit | the `WVA_SCALE_TO_ZERO` deployment flag |
| `retentionPeriod` | inherit | 10m (`DefaultScaleToZeroRetentionPeriod`) |

#### How long until a model actually reaches zero

**`retentionPeriod` and KEDA's `cooldownPeriod` add up.** They are sequential, not
overlapping, and neither knob alone predicts the result:

```text
last request ──┬─ retentionPeriod ─┬─ ≤1 optimize interval ─┬─ cooldownPeriod ─┬─ 0 replicas
               │ (the scaling manager's idle query)│ (the scaling manager publishes 0, the  │ (KEDA)           │
               │                   │  trigger goes inactive)│                  │
```

The scaling manager's external scaler reports the trigger active *unless the scaling manager has decided the model
needs zero replicas*, so KEDA's cooldown clock cannot start until the scaling manager has already
decided to park — and the scaling manager decides that only once `increase(...[retentionPeriod])`
reads zero. With both defaults that is **10m + 300s ≈ 15 minutes**, plus up to one
`GLOBAL_OPT_INTERVAL` (15s). A fleet that "will not park" is often just this sum.

This applies to the **deactivation step only** — the final drop to
`minReplicaCount`/`idleReplicaCount` once the trigger reports inactive. An ordinary
scale-down while the trigger is still active (10 → 3) goes through the HPA and is
governed by its own stabilization behaviour; neither KEDA cooldown is consulted.

The scaling manager adds no hold of its own here. KEDA already guards that one transition, per
ScaledObject, from cluster state — the same reason the scaling manager reads `minReplicaCount`
off the object rather than duplicating it into trigger metadata.

### `scaleFromZero`

An entry may tune how a model is woken from zero replicas:

```yaml
scaleFromZero: { requirePrefill: true }
```

| key | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requirePrefill` | `false` | Refuse to wake a P/D-disaggregated model unless a prefill variant can be placed alongside decode. |

**Why the default is `false`.** When the scale-from-zero engine picks which
variants to wake, decode is mandatory and prefill is best-effort. That follows
from how the llm-d router behaves rather than from a preference: with no prefill
endpoint selected it routes the request to a decode endpoint, and the decode
worker runs both stages locally. The router already declines disaggregation on
its own for short prompts and high prefix-cache hits, so decode-only is a normal
serving mode, not a failure mode. If prefill cannot be placed — no free GPUs on
its accelerator, or a namespace quota that excludes it — waking decode alone
still serves the queued request, whereas refusing to wake trades a slower model
for no model at all.

Set `requirePrefill: true` when degraded prefill performance is worse than
unavailability for this model: a strict TTFT SLO, or decode nodes that must not
absorb prefill load. With it set, a model whose prefill cannot be placed is left
at zero and the engine logs why at INFO:

```text
Scale-from-zero: no variant woken for a model with pending requests
  namespace=... modelID=... reason=prefill-required
```

Other `reason` values are `no-decode-candidate` (the model has no inactive
decode/`both` variant to wake) and `no-capacity` (nothing fit the GPU budget).
Each is logged once per verdict change, not once per poll. A model that is
already serving is not a refusal and is not reported here at all.

Role comes from the `llm-d.ai/role` pod-template label (`prefill`, `decode`, or
absent/`both`). A model with no prefill variants is unaffected by this setting.

**Placement.** Selection prefers a variant that can actually get GPUs, checked
against the same GPU/quota limiters the optimizer honours (see
[`limiters`](#limiters-cluster-default-only-live)) and evaluated on the **sum**
of the variants being woken together — prefill and decode can each fit alone
while the pair does not.

The check is **best-effort**: when the GPU budget cannot be determined it is
skipped rather than denying the wake, because refusing to serve a queued request
on the strength of a missing measurement is the worse failure. It is skipped
when any of these hold:

| condition | why |
| --- | --- |
| no limiter is configured | declaring no `limiters:` list means nothing bounds scaling, so there is nothing to place against. This is the shipped default |
| no usage snapshot yet | the saturation engine is the sole producer of GPU usage; until it completes one cycle there is no denominator. This is the state on the first cycle after a restart — exactly when a request may be queued |
| a provider failed to compute constraints | a partial view would deny any accelerator type the surviving providers happen not to mention, turning "could not reach this provider" into "cannot place this variant" |
| — | *(An unresolved accelerator does not skip the check: that candidate simply contributes no demand, and the rest of the set is still checked. A variant with no nodeSelector/nodeAffinity GPU key cannot be charged to any pool, so it is not counted rather than denied.)* |

> **The GPU budget can still over-state free capacity**, affecting the
> GPU-aware optimizer as well as scale-from-zero: usage on an unresolved
> accelerator is charged to no pool, and the physical `Limit` counts every
> *installed* GPU rather than what is actually available. Both are described,
> with their fixes and current status, in
> [GPU Capacity Accounting](../concepts/gpu-capacity-accounting.md). The short version: make
> the accelerator resolvable with a `nodeSelector`/`nodeAffinity` GPU key — the scaling manager
> emits an `AcceleratorNotResolved` event otherwise, and resolves a RUNNING
> variant by observing the nodes its pods landed on — and declare an explicit
> quota limiter if you need a hard ceiling.

Note the usage snapshot is published independently of the optimizer branch, so
scale-from-zero can check placement on a cycle the optimizer never reached.

There is no separate enable flag: the `limiters` list below is the whole answer.
Declaring a limiter selects the GPU-aware optimizer (`GreedyByScore`) *and* arms
the scale-from-zero capacity check; declaring none leaves both off. `enableLimiter`
used to gate only the first of those, so a quota could be declared and silently
never enforced, while scale-from-zero consulted a limiter nobody had asked for.

### `limiters` (cluster-default only, live)

The `default` entry selects the GPU limiter for the scaling pipeline. This is the
**sole source** — there is no `--limiter-type` flag or quota config file — and it is
applied **live**: editing the ConfigMap switches the limiter without a controller
restart (the engine rebuilds it on the next optimization cycle).

A `limiters:` list selects a **single mode**, so declare **one** of these forms:

```yaml
# (a) physical-capacity limiter. NOT a default -- with no limiters: list,
# nothing limits at all (NewLimiterFromConfig returns a no-op limiter):
default: |
  analyzers:
    - type: saturation
  limiters:
    - type: gpu-inventory            # alias: inventory

# (b) operator-declared quota limiter:
default: |
  analyzers:
    - type: saturation
  limiters:
    - type: quota                    # inline quota entry — same schema as QuotaLimiterConfig
      name: cluster-h100
      scope: cluster
      quotas: { H100: 32 }
```

- **Single mode.** If a list contains both a `quota` and a `gpu-inventory` entry, the
  quota entry wins and the `gpu-inventory` entry is ignored — only one limiter is built.
  (Composition of physical + quota caps is tracked separately in #1003.)
- `type: quota` uses the **same schema** as `QuotaLimiterConfig`, so `scope`, `quotas`,
  `namespaceQuotas`, and `exclude` all apply; multiple quota entries are composed.
  A quota entry may also set `kueue: { enabled: true }` to be bounded by the quotas
  Kueue declares — see [Kueue as a quota source](quota-limiter.md#kueue-as-a-quota-source).
- **Cluster-default only.** The list is read only from the global (system-namespace)
  `default` entry — a budget-scope setting, like `enableRescale` — so a tenant cannot
  widen a cap via a per-model or namespace-local entry. A `limiters:` block placed on any
  other entry parses and validates but is **silently ignored** at runtime.
- With no `limiters:` block **nothing bounds scaling** — that is the shipped
  default, and the controller says so at startup: "scaling is UNCONSTRAINED".

### `optimizer` (cluster-default only, live)

The `optimizer:` block, beside `limiters:` in the same `default` entry, selects
the **utilization-share optimizer**. Without it, a quota that runs out is first
come, first served: whichever model scaled up earlier keeps its GPUs, and a model
that needs them later waits. With it, the GPUs a quota allows are shared out on
purpose. Every role (the decode and prefill of a P/D model, or the one role of an
aggregated model) is first given its *need* — the GPUs that put it exactly at its
`scaleUpThreshold` — and what is left is shared as headroom above that need, in
proportion to each model's weight. When the GPUs no longer match those targets,
the optimizer *transfers* replicas: it scales a donor down, waits until its GPUs
are actually released, and only then scales the receiver up.

The design and its reasoning are in the
[utilization-share optimizer proposal](../proposals/utilization-share-optimizer.md);
this section covers what you set and what you will see.

**It needs a budget.** The optimizer shares the GPUs a limiter allows, so it
needs a `limiters:` list. Without one it stays off and the controller logs
`needs a limiters: list: there is no budget to share`. It plans:

- one group per namespace that a namespace quota (`scope: namespace`) covers, per
  accelerator type;
- one cluster group per accelerator type for every other model, when the cluster
  limiter is a `quota`. Under a `gpu-inventory` limiter alone there is no cluster
  group unless you set `physicalGroups: true` (see the table).

A model whose variants run on more than one accelerator type, or whose analyzer
result is not live this cycle, is left to today's optimizer for that cycle.

**Start in shadow mode.** `shadow` defaults to `false`, so
`optimizer: {type: utilizationShare}` on its own **acts**: it moves replicas
between models from the next cycle. Turn it on in shadow first, read what it
would do, and switch `shadow` off when the numbers look right:

```yaml
default: |
  analyzers:
    - type: saturation
  limiters:
    - type: quota
      name: cluster-h100
      scope: cluster
      quotas: { H100: 32 }
  optimizer:
    type: utilizationShare
    utilizationShare:
      shadow: true          # compute, publish and log; move nothing
```

In shadow mode every evaluation metric is published
([utilization-share metrics](prometheus.md#utilization-share-optimizer-metrics)),
and the controller logs `Shadow: utilization share would rebalance` whenever a
move would be planned. `wva_utilization_share_actionable == 1` names the roles it
would move; `wva_utilization_share_replicas_to_move` says how many replicas.

| Key (under `utilizationShare:`) | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tolerance` | `0.15` | How far a role's GPUs may be from its target, as a fraction of the target, before a move is considered. Must be greater than 0 and less than 1. Wider means fewer, larger moves. |
| `reserveGPUs` | `0` | GPUs held out of the shared budget so a scale-from-zero wake can start at once instead of waiting for a transfer. |
| `shadow` | `false` | Compute, publish and log everything; actuate nothing. |
| `physicalGroups` | `false` | Also plan groups bounded only by the physical GPU inventory (no quota), where spending the whole budget means holding every GPU of that type. |
| `weightClasses` | `best-effort: 0.5`, `standard: 1`, `important: 2`, `critical: 4` | Class names and their weights. Replaces the defaults whole when set. Exactly one class must have weight `1`; it is the default class. |
| `namespaces.<ns>.enabled` | `true` | `false` keeps that namespace's quota group on today's optimizer. |

Nothing else is configurable. The timings a transfer runs on — how long a release
may take, how long a receiver may stay Pending, how long a role that gave must wait
before it receives — are derived from each donor's ScaledObject (scale-down
window, polling interval) and pod template (termination grace), and from the
releases the group has measured. `wva_utilization_share_effective_seconds` shows
the values in force and where each came from.

**Weights.** A model's weight decides how much of the spare headroom its roles
get and, when the quota is short, whose shortfall counts most: a role of weight 2
gets twice the headroom of a role of weight 1 relative to its need, and is cut
last. Set it per model with **one** of:

```yaml
  # a per-model override (or the default entry, for every model)
  ibm_granite-13b.production: |
    model_id: ibm/granite-13b
    namespace: production
    weightClass: important     # a class name from weightClasses
    # weight: 1.5              # or a number, clamped into the range the classes span
```

A model that sets neither gets the default class. An unknown class, a weight that
is not a positive number, or both fields set fall back to the default class and
log `invalid weight on a model's scaling-policy entry`; none of them rejects the
entry. A number outside the classes' range (0.5 to 4 with the default classes) is
clamped into it.

A namespace with its own namespace-local scaling-policy map sets its models'
weights and thresholds itself. Such a model is planned in its namespace's own
quota group, which that namespace owns whole, but **not** in the cluster group,
where its weight would be weighed against other tenants'; there today's optimizer
keeps it.

**Disabling one namespace:**

```yaml
  optimizer:
    type: utilizationShare
    utilizationShare:
      namespaces:
        team-a: { enabled: false }
```

This applies to namespace quota groups only. A name that no namespace quota covers
disables nothing, and the controller logs
`Optimizer namespaces block disables namespaces no namespace quota names`.

**Where the block is read.** Like `limiters:`, only from the cluster `default`
entry, and live: an edit takes effect on the next cycle. An `optimizer:` block in
a namespace-local scaling-policy map has no effect; the controller logs
`ignoring optimizer blocks in namespace-local scaling-policy maps` with the
namespaces. A malformed block (an unknown key, a value out of range) turns only
the optimizer off and logs `Invalid optimizer block; keeping today's optimizer`;
the limiters in the same entry keep working.

**What it writes on pods.** While a transfer releases, each donor pod it chose
carries two annotations: `llm-d.ai/utilization-share-transfer` (the transfer, as
JSON, including the pod's previous deletion cost) and
`controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost: "-1000"`, so the ReplicaSet removes
that pod and not a sibling. A restarted controller rebuilds its in-flight
transfers from these marks. The controller removes both, restoring the pod's
previous deletion cost, when the transfer ends, when the optimizer is switched to
shadow or off (including across a controller restart), and when no quota has been
read for two minutes. Each controller removes
only the marks it wrote (they record its `CONTROLLER_INSTANCE`). Downgrading to a version
without the optimizer leaves them behind; see
[marks left after a downgrade](troubleshooting.md#transfer-marks-left-on-pods-after-a-downgrade).

**Namespace-scoped installs** cannot list nodes, so the optimizer plans by GPU
count alone: it does not check that the GPUs a donor frees are on a node where
the receiver's pod fits, and the two blocked reasons that need node information
(`release-taken`, `release-shape-mismatch`) never appear.

## Configuration

### ConfigMap Structure

The saturation scaling configuration is stored in a ConfigMap named `wva-scaling-policy-config` in llm-scaling-manager controller's namespace.

**Location:** `deploy/configmap-scaling-policy.yaml`

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Recommended |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `kvCacheThreshold` | float64 | Replica is considered saturated if KV cache utilization ≥ threshold (0.0-1.0) | 0.80 |
| `queueLengthThreshold` | float64 | Replica is considered saturated if queue length ≥ threshold | 5 |
| `scaleUpThreshold` | float64 | Model-level utilization threshold above which scale-up is triggered (0.0-1.0). Applied by the engine post-step to every analyzer's result. | 0.85 |
| `scaleDownBoundary` | float64 | Model-level utilization boundary below which scale-down is safe (0.0-1.0). Applied by the engine post-step to every analyzer's result. | 0.70 |

### V2 Analyzer Parameters

These parameters apply when `analyzerName: "saturation"` is set or when the `analyzers:` list is populated.

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `analyzerName` | string | Legacy selector, retained for backward compatibility: `"saturation"` names the token-based analyzer, which also runs when the field is empty. Prefer the `analyzers:` list, which the shipped default uses. | `""` |
| `priority` | float64 | Multiplier for this model's scaling urgency in fair-share GPU allocation | 1.0 |
| `analyzers` | list | Multi-analyzer pipeline registration — see [Multi-Analyzer Registration](#multi-analyzer-registration) | `[{name: "saturation", score: 1.0}]` |

> `scaleUpThreshold` and `scaleDownBoundary` are honored only for saturation on this branch; see the `multi-analyzer-threshold` PR for the universal post-step that calibrates RC/SC across all analyzers.

### Expected output length

This one is **not** a ConfigMap field. It is set on the ScaledObject, beside
`modelID`, and a `defaultOutputTokens` key in this ConfigMap is ignored:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: external-push
    metadata:
      scalerAddress: wva-external-scaler.<wva-namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9090
      modelID: ibm/granite-13b
      defaultOutputTokens: "6000"
```

The scaling manager prices each request waiting in the router queue at the
generation length it expects that request to produce: a queued request owes the
decode role `O` tokens of work, and that is what makes a growing queue worth
ordering capacity for. `O` is the first of these that is a positive number:

| source | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| the fleet's own reading | the output length the running replicas are averaging over their recent completions |
| the fleet's last known shape | the stable shape the throughput keys are built from, which carries the figure across a gap in readings |
| `defaultOutputTokens` | this key |
| the built-in default | 512 tokens |

Set it when the deployment's generations are materially longer than a chat
completion. Until a replica has completed a generation there is no reading to
use — the first cycles after a restart, after a scale from zero, or after the
arriving traffic changes shape — and the built-in 512 under-states a
6000-token workload by a factor of twelve. A queue priced low is a queue that
does not order, and that is paid in time-to-first-token.

It is a seed for that window only. The fleet's own measurement displaces it as
soon as one exists, so a figure of the right order is what matters and an exact
one buys nothing.

A value the scaling manager cannot read as a whole number of tokens is
**rejected at the trigger that carried it**, with an error naming the key and
quoting the value — `"lots"`, `"-1"` and `"6000.5"` are all refused rather than
read as zero, because the only view an operator gets of a bad value is that
error. `"0"` is the one exception: it is accepted and means *unset*, exactly as
leaving the key out does, so the table above falls through to the built-in
default. Prefer omitting the key to writing `"0"` — the two behave identically
and the omission says so.

**Why the trigger and not this ConfigMap.** The figure is a fact about one
workload's traffic, not a threshold a class of workloads shares — a
fleet-wide generation length is already what the built-in 512 is. It sits beside
`replicaStartSeconds`, the other per-workload seed, for the same reason.

**When a model's variants disagree.** A model under P/D has a ScaledObject per
role, so the key can be written twice. The **largest** figure wins, and the
disagreement is logged with every figure that was named. Largest, because only
one role generates tokens: a prefill trigger carrying nothing must not pull
decode's figure down to the built-in fallback, and under-pricing a queue is the
failure the key exists to fix. Writing it on one variant and leaving it off the
others is the simplest way to get this right.

### Default Configuration

Since v0.9.0 the shipped `default` entry selects **V2** (token/capacity-based) via
the `analyzers:` list:

```yaml
analyzers:
  - name: saturation
    score: 1.0
# Scaling band:
scaleUpThreshold: 0.85
scaleDownBoundary: 0.70
# Capacity sizing:
kvCacheThreshold: 0.80
queueLengthThreshold: 5
```

Every field has a hardcoded default, so a missing ConfigMap (or a missing
`default` entry) degrades gracefully rather than pinning the analyzer at zero
thresholds. Deploying the ConfigMap with a `default` entry is still recommended
so the values are explicit and reviewable.

## Multi-Analyzer Registration

The V2 engine carries an analyzer registry so external analyzers (e.g.
throughput, SLO) can be plugged in without the engine package knowing the
concrete type. Each cycle the engine iterates every registered analyzer in
registration order and invokes its `Analyze` method.

> **Scope note.** Saturation drives every scaling decision on its own.
> Non-saturation analyzers are registered and invoked, but their results
> are **not yet consumed** — combine semantics and per-analyzer score
> consumption land in a follow-up PR (`multi-analyzer-optimizer`). The
> hooks below are wired so that follow-up can hang its behavior off them
> without further engine changes.

### Registering Analyzers

Pre-registered:

- The V2 saturation analyzer is pre-registered by `NewEngine` under
  `interfaces.SaturationAnalyzerName`. It always runs and drives the
  optimizer.

External analyzers are registered from `cmd/main.go` via:

```go
if err := engine.RegisterAnalyzer(name, analyzer); err != nil {
    // handle: duplicate name or called after StartOptimizeLoop
}
```

`RegisterAnalyzer` appends to the registry and returns an `error` for
two misuse conditions: calling it after `StartOptimizeLoop` or
re-registering an existing name. Callers must check the error. Registration
order defines processing order in the engine loop and should match the
operator's `analyzers:` config order.

`RegisterAnalyzer` must be called before `StartOptimizeLoop`.

### Configuring Analyzers

The `analyzers:` list shapes the configuration for the registered analyzers:

```yaml
analyzerName: saturation
scaleUpThreshold: 0.85
scaleDownBoundary: 0.70
analyzers:
  - name: saturation
    score: 1.0
  - name: throughput
    score: 1.0
```

When `analyzers:` is omitted **and** `analyzerName: "saturation"` is set, the list
defaults to `[{name: "saturation", score: 1.0}]`. When both are omitted the
token-based analyzer still runs (see [Analyzer Selection](#analyzer-selection));
the list is simply left empty, which also leaves the scaling band to be defaulted
post-merge.

### AnalyzerScoreConfig Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | string | Analyzer name (must match a `RegisterAnalyzer` call) | required |
| `enabled` | bool | Reserved — placeholder for future combine logic | `true` |
| `score` | float64 | Reserved — placeholder for future combine logic | `1.0` |
| `scaleUpThreshold` | float64 | Per-analyzer override for the scale-up threshold; honored by the engine post-step (see Universal Threshold Post-Step below) | global `scaleUpThreshold` |
| `scaleDownBoundary` | float64 | Per-analyzer override for the scale-down boundary; honored by the engine post-step (see Universal Threshold Post-Step below) | global `scaleDownBoundary` |

### Analyzer responsibilities and the universal threshold post-step

#### Per-variant data is canonical

`interfaces.VariantCapacity` is the single source of truth for per-variant primitives. Analyzers populate it; the engine and optimizer read it.

| Field | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `ReplicaCount`, `PendingReplicas`, `PerReplicaCapacity`, `Cost`, `Role`, `AcceleratorName` | Analyzer | Optimizer (per-variant scaling math + picker) |
| `TotalCapacity`, `TotalDemand`, `Utilization` | Analyzer | Sat_v2 internal aggregation; `Utilization` passed through to `VariantDecision.Utilization` for metric emission |
| `r.TotalSupply`, `r.TotalAnticipatedSupply`, `r.TotalDemand` | Analyzer (via shared helpers) | Engine post-step |
| `r.RoleCapacities[role].TotalSupply/TotalAnticipatedSupply/TotalDemand` | Analyzer (via shared helpers) | Engine post-step |
| `r.RequiredCapacity`, `r.SpareCapacity` | **Engine post-step only** | Optimizer |
| `r.RoleCapacities[role].RequiredCapacity/SpareCapacity` | **Engine post-step only** | Optimizer (P/D disaggregation) |

#### Analyzer inputs

`interfaces.AnalyzerInput` carries the shared inputs every analyzer reads:
replica metrics, variant states, the model's resolved config, and
`SchedulerQueue`. None of these are analyzer-specific.

`SchedulerQueue` represents requests queued upstream of any pod (in the
llm-d flow control layer). Queue items are model-scoped and **not yet
attributed to any variant or role**. Any analyzer with a demand model may
use it — sat_v2 does today; the throughput analyzer will when it lands.

**Demand extraction from the queue is per-analyzer.** Each analyzer
converts queue depth/bytes into demand in its own unit (sat_v2:
kv-tokens; throughput: tokens/sec). Each analyzer also decides how to
attribute that demand across roles or variants — sat_v2 splits it among
active roles.

#### Per-replica demand and the role-aware waiting-queue charge

Distinct from `SchedulerQueue` above, each replica also reports its own **local
engine queue** (`vllm:num_requests_waiting` / `sglang:num_queue_reqs`) — requests
already admitted to that pod but not yet generating. sat_v2 charges them to the
replica, so per-replica demand has two terms:

```text
replicaDemand = <resident KV tokens> + QueueLength × <per-request charge>
```

The resident term is `TokensInUse` on the main path, or
`KvCacheUsage × effectiveCapacity` on the fallback path (no
`vllm:cache_config_info`). The per-request charge depends on the variant's P/D
role, because a replica only pays for KV it actually materializes:

| Role | Per-request charge | Rationale |
|------|--------------------|-----------|
| `prefill` | `AvgInputTokens` | Prompt KV only; output is generated on a decode pod |
| `decode` | `AvgInputTokens + AvgOutputTokens` | Holds prompt KV and grows it per generated token |
| `both` (default) | `AvgInputTokens + AvgOutputTokens` | Handles the full request lifecycle |

An absent or empty role canonicalizes to `both`, so **non-disaggregated
deployments take the decode-style charge** — correct for a replica serving the
whole request, but it means the majority of deployments include output tokens.

`AvgInputTokens + AvgOutputTokens` is the footprint at a request's *final* decode
step, chosen as a peak / no-preemption planning charge: KV grows monotonically
once generation starts and cannot be shed without preemption and recompute.

**`I + O` is the saturation analyzer's demand-side unit; `ILeff + O/2` is the
throughput analyzer's.** The two are separate analyzers with separate
demand/supply models, so the difference is by design, not an inconsistency:

| Analyzer | Per-request KV unit | Meaning |
|----------|--------------------|---------|
| Saturation V2 (demand) | `I + O` | Peak footprint — what a replica must be able to hold |
| Throughput (`shape.Shape.KVreq`) | `ILeff + O/2` | Time-averaged residency (`ILeff = I × (1 − PrefixHitRate)`) |

One asymmetry *is* internal to saturation V2 and should not be confused with the
above: its own k2 derivation (`estimateCapacityFromParams`) prices a *concurrent*
request at `I + O/2`. So a queued request is charged more than it occupies on
average, biasing this term toward scale-up — accepted deliberately, since
under-provisioning decode capacity causes preemption thrash. Changing it means
moving the demand/capacity pair together. See the `waitingQueueDemand` doc
comment for the full trade-off.

Note both demand terms derive from 1-minute maxima (`max_over_time` on
`kv_cache_usage_perc` and `num_requests_waiting`), whose peaks need not coincide,
so their sum can exceed any single instant's demand. That is a property of the
collector's queries, not of the role charge.

#### Linearity invariant

The optimizer's per-variant scaling math (`bottleneckReplicas`, `safeRemovalReplicas`, `applyAllocation`) assumes that `n` replicas of variant `v` reduce model-level RC by exactly `n × PRC[v]`. That means `Total*` must equal the canonical sum over variants:

```text
r.TotalSupply            == Σ_v vc.ReplicaCount × vc.PerReplicaCapacity
r.TotalAnticipatedSupply == Σ_v (vc.ReplicaCount + vc.PendingReplicas) × vc.PerReplicaCapacity
r.TotalDemand            == Σ_v vc.TotalDemand
r.RoleCapacities[role].* == same sums filtered by vc.Role == role
```

Use the shared helpers in `internal/engines/aggregation/` to compute these. An analyzer that doesn't use the helpers takes responsibility for producing identical math — otherwise the optimizer's per-variant allocation silently breaks.

#### Shared aggregation helpers

```go
import "github.com/llm-d/llm-d-workload-variant-autoscaler/internal/engines/aggregation"

r.TotalSupply            = aggregation.SumTotalSupply(variantCapacities)
r.TotalAnticipatedSupply = aggregation.SumTotalAnticipatedSupply(variantCapacities)
r.TotalDemand            = aggregation.SumTotalDemand(variantCapacities)

// For P/D disaggregated models:
totals := aggregation.AggregateByRole(variantCapacities)
// → map[role]aggregation.ScopeTotals{TotalSupply, TotalAnticipatedSupply, TotalDemand}
```

`AggregateByRole` canonicalizes empty role to `interfaces.RoleBoth`.

#### Engine post-step formula

After each analyzer's `Analyze()` returns, the engine applies the universal threshold formula at **every scope** — model level and each `RoleCapacity` entry:

```text
RC = max(0, TotalDemand / scaleUpThreshold − TotalAnticipatedSupply)
SC = max(0, TotalSupply  − TotalDemand / scaleDownBoundary)
```

`TotalAnticipatedSupply` is read as-is — **zero is a literal value, not a sentinel**. For a model scaled to zero with positive demand, RC = TotalDemand/scaleUp (the correct "this much capacity needed" answer). Analyzers must populate `TotalAnticipatedSupply` via `SumTotalAnticipatedSupply`; the engine does not walk `VariantCapacities` as a fallback.

The asymmetry — anticipated supply for scale-up, steady-state `TotalSupply` for scale-down — preserves the conservative "don't double-scale while replicas are launching, don't count pending as removable" stance.

**P/D disaggregation.** The same formula and the same `(scaleUp, scaleDown)` values are applied to every `RoleCapacity` entry. Threshold configuration is common regardless of role — there are no per-role overrides. The optimizer receives fully calibrated per-role RC/SC and uses them for P/D replica allocation.

**Per-analyzer threshold overrides.** `analyzers[].scaleUpThreshold` / `analyzers[].scaleDownBoundary` are resolved per analyzer: a per-entry override takes precedence over the model-level global. The resolved pair is applied uniformly at model level and every role for that analyzer. An opt-out flag for analyzers with non-universal calibration math is deferred to a follow-up.

### Saturation Always Runs

The saturation analyzer executes on every cycle regardless of any future
`enabled` flag — its `VariantCapacities` carry `Cost` and `AcceleratorName`
required by the optimizer for variant selection and GPU accounting. On
this branch saturation's `RequiredCapacity` and `SpareCapacity` are the
only signals the optimizer consumes.

### Resilience

Each registered non-saturation analyzer runs in isolation: errors are
logged and discarded, and panics are recovered. A faulty plugin analyzer
cannot take down the optimize goroutine or block saturation from driving
the scaling decision.

## Best Practices: Coordinating with InferenceScheduler (End Point Picker)

### What is End Point Picker (EPP)?

The **End Point Picker (EPP)** is an intelligent request routing component in the InferenceScheduler that selects the optimal inference server replica to handle each incoming request. EPP monitors replica capacity metrics (KV cache utilization, queue depth), as well as other replica metrics and uses scoring algorithms to route requests to replicas.

### Deployment Architecture

**EPP Deployment Model**: Each model has a **1-to-1 relationship** with its EPP instance. Every model served by the inference infrastructure has a dedicated EPP component that routes requests specifically to that model's replicas.

**Example deployment pattern:**
- Model: `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` in namespace `<your-namespace>` → Dedicated EPP instance `gaie-workload-autoscaler-epp`
- Model: `ibm/granite-13b` in namespace `production` → Dedicated EPP instance `gaie-production-epp`
- Each model deployment has its own EPP instance (naming follows namespace/workload convention)

This 1-to-1 architecture means that saturation detection and request routing decisions are **model-specific**, with each EPP instance monitoring only its associated model's replicas.

### Threshold Alignment Recommendation

**For optimal cluster performance, we strongly recommend using the same threshold values for both the scaling manager (llm-scaling-manager) and InferenceScheduler (End Point Picker) for each model deployment.**

Using aligned thresholds ensures consistent capacity management across the cluster and prevents request drop situations.

**Why threshold alignment matters:**

1. **Reduced Request Drop Rates**: When the scaling manager and EPP use the same saturation thresholds, the scheduler will avoid routing requests to replicas that the scaling manager already considers saturated. This prevents the scheduler from overloading replicas that are about to trigger scale-up.

2. **Consistent Capacity Assessment**: Both components evaluate replica capacity using the same criteria (KV cache utilization and queue length), ensuring coordinated behavior across the entire inference stack.

3. **Improved GPU Utilization**: Aligned thresholds allow the cluster to maintain optimal GPU utilization without oversaturation. The scheduler respects the same capacity boundaries that drive autoscaling decisions.

4. **Faster Response to Load Changes**: When both components agree on saturation thresholds, the system responds more quickly to load changes with coordinated routing and scaling actions.

### Configuration Comparison

#### llm-scaling-manager Saturation Scaling Configuration

```yaml
# llm-scaling-manager Configuration (wva-scaling-policy-config ConfigMap)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wva-scaling-policy-config
  namespace: <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace>
data:
  default: |
    analyzers:                    # selects V2 (default since v0.9.0)
      - name: saturation
        score: 1.0
    kvCacheThreshold: 0.80        # Should match EPP kvCacheUtilThreshold
    queueLengthThreshold: 5       # Should match EPP queueDepthThreshold
```

#### EPP Saturation Detector Configuration

The InferenceScheduler EPP component uses the [gateway-api-inference-extension](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/blob/main/site-src/guides/epp-configuration/config-text.md) saturation detector to identify cluster overload.

**Per-Model Configuration**: Since each model has its own dedicated EPP instance, saturation detection is configured **per model deployment**. This allows different models to have different saturation thresholds based on their specific characteristics and SLO requirements.

```yaml
# EPP Saturation Detector Configuration (per-model EPP instance)
saturationDetector:
  ...
  queueDepthThreshold: 5          # Default: 5 - Backend waiting queue size threshold
  kvCacheUtilThreshold: 0.8       # Default: 0.8 - KV cache utilization threshold (0.0-1.0)
  ...
```

**Configuration Notes**:
- All parameters are optional; omitting them applies the documented defaults
- EPP configuration is **read only on startup** - changes require EPP pod restart
- Unlike the scaling manager, EPP does not currently support live ConfigMap updates
- **Each EPP instance** (one per model) can have different threshold values

### Parameter Mapping and Alignment

| Concept | llm-scaling-manager Field | EPP Field | Aligned Default | Description |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **KV Cache Saturation** | `kvCacheThreshold` | `kvCacheUtilThreshold` | **0.80** (80%) | Replica is saturated when KV cache ≥ threshold |
| **Queue Saturation** | `queueLengthThreshold` | `queueDepthThreshold` | **5** | Replica is saturated when queue length ≥ threshold |
| **Scale-Up Trigger (KV)** | **Scale-Up Trigger (Queue)** 
### Configuration Workflow

#### Step 1: Define Thresholds

Choose thresholds based on your workload characteristics and SLO requirements:

| Workload Type | kvCacheThreshold | queueLengthThreshold | Rationale |
|---------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Conservative** (Default) | 0.80 | 5 | Balanced performance and utilization |
| **Aggressive** (High GPU utilization) | 0.90 | 15 | Maximize GPU usage, higher latency variance |
| **Strict** (Low latency SLO) | 0.70 | 3 | Prioritize responsiveness, lower utilization |

#### Step 2: Apply to the scaling manager

Update `wva-scaling-policy-config` ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl edit cm wva-scaling-policy-config -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace>
```

Changes take effect **immediately** (the scaling manager watches ConfigMap and auto-reloads).

#### Step 3: Apply to EPP

**Important**: Since each model has its own dedicated EPP instance (1-to-1 relationship), you must configure the EPP instance for **each specific model deployment** separately.

**Current approach:**

1. Identify the EPP instance for your target model:
   ```bash
   # Example: Find EPP deployment for a specific model in namespace
   kubectl get deployments -n <your-namespace> | grep epp
   ```

2. Update the EPP instance's environment variables or configuration file for that specific model

3. Restart the EPP pod for that model:
   ```bash
   # Restart the specific model's EPP instance
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/gaie-<model-name>-epp -n <namespace>
   ```

**Example for multiple models:**
```bash
# Model 1: granite-13b in production
kubectl rollout restart deployment/gaie-granite-13b-epp -n production

# Model 2: llama-70b in lab
kubectl rollout restart deployment/gaie-llama-70b-epp -n lab
```

#### Step 4: Verify Configuration

**the scaling manager verification:**
```bash
kubectl get cm wva-scaling-policy-config -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace> -o yaml
```

**EPP verification (per-model instance):**
```bash
# Check specific model's EPP pod logs for loaded configuration
kubectl logs -n <namespace> deployment/gaie-<model-name>-epp --all-containers | grep -i "saturation\|threshold"

# Example: Verify EPP configuration for granite-13b model in production
kubectl logs -n production deployment/gaie-granite-13b-epp --all-containers | grep -i "saturation\|threshold"
```

### Alignment Best Practices

1. **Core Thresholds Must Match Per Model**:
   - `kvCacheThreshold` (the scaling manager) = `kvCacheUtilThreshold` (EPP)
   - `queueLengthThreshold` (the scaling manager) = `queueDepthThreshold` (EPP)
   - **Important**: Since each model has its own EPP instance, ensure thresholds align for **each model deployment** individually

2. **Per-Model Configuration Strategy**:
   - Use the scaling manager's per-model override feature to set model-specific thresholds
   - Configure the corresponding EPP instance with matching thresholds
   - Document the threshold mapping for each model deployment
   - Example: If `ibm/granite-13b` uses `kvCacheThreshold: 0.85` in the scaling manager, its dedicated EPP must use `kvCacheUtilThreshold: 0.85`


4. **Testing Threshold Changes**:
   - Test in development environment first
   - Monitor impact on request drop rate and latency for the specific model
   - Adjust based on observed behavior
   - Remember to update both the scaling manager and the model's EPP instance

## Usage

### 1. Using Default Configuration

Deploying without a ConfigMap is safe — the analyzer falls back to its hardcoded
defaults. Shipping a `default` entry is still recommended so the thresholds are
explicit and reviewable.

If the ConfigMap is missing, the system will log a warning:
```text
INFO No cluster policy ConfigMap in the policy namespace
```

### 2. Customizing Global Defaults

Edit `deploy/configmap-scaling-policy.yaml`. Keeping the `analyzers:` section
is recommended: it states the analyzer and its score explicitly, and it makes the
entry V2-shaped so the scaling band is defaulted on the entry itself (see
[Analyzer Selection](#analyzer-selection)):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wva-scaling-policy-config
  namespace: <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace>
data:
  default: |
    analyzers:
      - name: saturation
        score: 1.0
    scaleUpThreshold: 0.85      # scaling band
    scaleDownBoundary: 0.70     # scaling band
    kvCacheThreshold: 0.75      # capacity sizing
    queueLengthThreshold: 10    # capacity sizing
```

Apply the ConfigMap:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/configmap-scaling-policy.yaml
```

**Note:** Changes take effect immediately! The controller watches the ConfigMap and automatically:
1. Reloads the cache when changes are detected
2. Triggers a reconcile of every discovered variant
3. Applies the new configuration without requiring pod restart

### 3. Named Policy Tiers

A tier is a reusable entry — `interactive`, `standard`, `batch` — that a variant
selects **by name** from its ScaledObject. A tier carries no model identity, which
is the whole point: one tier serves many models, and retuning the tier retunes all
of them at once. Per-model entries cannot express that, because they bind settings
to identity, so a fleet-wide change becomes an edit per model.

An entry is a tier when its key is not `default` and its body sets no `model_id`
(`PolicyEntryKey`).

```yaml
data:
  default: |
    analyzers:
      - name: saturation
        score: 1.0
    scaleUpThreshold: 0.85
    scaleDownBoundary: 0.70
    priority: 1.0
    defaultPolicy: standard      # tier applied to variants that name none

  interactive: |
    priority: 5.0
    scaleUpThreshold: 0.75

  batch: |
    priority: 0.5
```

A variant selects its tier through KEDA trigger metadata — the trigger is already
the registration, so this needs nothing watched, listed, or matched:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: external-push
    metadata:
      scalerAddress: wva-external-scaler.<wva-namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9090
      modelID: ibm/granite-13b
      scalingPolicy: interactive
```

**Resolution order** — most specific wins (`ResolveScalingPolicyForTier`):

| layer | source | scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default` entry | the ConfigMap's `default` key | fleet-wide fallback |
| named tier | the variant's `scalingPolicy`, else `default.defaultPolicy` | a class of workloads |
| per-model override | an entry whose body names this model | one model in one namespace |
| trigger metadata | per-workload seeds on the ScaledObject, e.g. `defaultOutputTokens` | one workload |

`defaultPolicy` is read from the `default` entry only: a fallback chosen by a tier
or by a per-model entry would be that entry choosing for everyone but itself.

Two failure modes are resolved deterministically rather than silently, and both
are reported:

- **Unknown tier** — a `scalingPolicy` naming no entry falls back to `default`.
  That is the right outcome and the wrong silence, so it is logged against the
  variants that asked for it, listing the tiers that do exist.
- **Disagreeing variants** — when variants of one model name different tiers, the
  lexicographically smallest wins, so the allocation resolves the same way on
  every cycle and every replica rather than flipping with map order.

### 4. Per-Model Overrides

Add model-specific configuration entries to override defaults for specific model/namespace pairs.

The saturation engine resolves per-model config using a lookup key in the format
an entry whose body names the model (see `internal/config/scaling_policy.go` — `ResolveScalingPolicy()`).
The ConfigMap data key **must** match this format for overrides to take effect.
Lookup order: `modelID#namespace` → `default` → zero-value with defaults applied.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wva-scaling-policy-config
  namespace: <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace>
data:
  default: |
    analyzers:              # selects V2 (default since v0.9.0)
      - name: saturation
        score: 1.0
    scaleUpThreshold: 0.85
    scaleDownBoundary: 0.70
    kvCacheThreshold: 0.80
    queueLengthThreshold: 5

  # Override for granite model in production namespace. Overrides inherit the
  # default's analyzer selection (V2) via field-level merge, so they only list the
  # thresholds they change.
  ibm_granite-13b.production: |
    model_id: ibm/granite-13b
    namespace: production
    kvCacheThreshold: 0.85

  # Override for llama model in lab namespace
  meta_llama-70b.lab: |
    model_id: meta/llama-70b
    namespace: lab
    kvCacheThreshold: 0.80
    queueLengthThreshold: 20
```

> **The `model_id` and `namespace` lines are not decoration — they are what makes
> this an override.** An entry whose body names no model is registered as a named
> policy *tier* instead (`PolicyEntryKey` in `internal/config/scaling_policy.go`),
> so it will never apply to the model you meant and will silently be selectable by

> and could never be applied. `ModelOverrideKey()` suggests a legal, readable key.

**Key points:**
- An override entry is identified by its **body**: set `model_id` and `namespace`. Its ConfigMap key is arbitrary — pick something readable
- The `model_id` and `namespace` YAML fields inside the entry are parsed but **not used for lookup**
- Overrides use **field-level merge**: only non-zero fields in the override replace the corresponding values from `default`; any field you omit (or set to its zero value) inherits from `default`. See `Merge()` in `internal/config/saturation_scaling.go`.
- Multiple overrides can exist for different model/namespace combinations

### 5. Per-Model Overrides — Field-Level Inheritance

Overrides are merged onto `default` field by field: only non-zero fields in the override
replace values from `default`, and any field you omit inherits from `default`. To change
just one threshold, specify only that field:

```yaml
  # Inherits queueLengthThreshold from `default`
  my-org_my-model.my-namespace: |
    model_id: my-org/my-model
    namespace: my-namespace
    kvCacheThreshold: 0.90
```

> **Gotcha:** Because `Merge()` only overlays non-zero values, an override cannot force
> a field to its zero value — the override is treated as "unset" and inherits from
> `default` instead. This affects every field type, not just numeric thresholds:
>
> - `analyzers: []` → inherits from `default` (cannot clear a non-empty analyzer list)
> - `enableRescale: false` → inherits from `default` (cannot disable rescale per model)
>
> See `Merge()` in `internal/config/saturation_scaling.go`.

## Validation

The controller validates all configuration entries on load. Invalid entries are logged and skipped:

### Validation Rules

1. **KvCacheThreshold:** Must be between 0.0 and 1.0
2. **QueueLengthThreshold:** Must be ≥ 0
6. **Priority:** Must be ≥ 0
7. **V2 thresholds** (when set): `scaleUpThreshold` and `scaleDownBoundary` must be in (0, 1],
   and `scaleUpThreshold` must be > `scaleDownBoundary`. Per-analyzer overrides are range-checked too.
8. **Limiters:** each `type` must be `gpu-inventory`/`inventory` or `quota`; a `gpu-inventory` entry
   must carry no quota fields; `quota` entries are validated end-to-end against the `QuotaLimiterConfig`
   schema (name uniqueness, scope, per-type ranges).

> Analyzer `type`/`name` values are **not** restricted to a fixed set — an unrecognized analyzer is
> simply ignored at runtime, so externally-registered analyzers and newer built-ins do not fail validation.

### Example Validation Errors

**Invalid entry (logged and skipped):**
```yaml
  invalid-config: |
    model_id: test/model
    namespace: test
    kvCacheThreshold: 1.5  # ERROR: Must be ≤ 1.0
```

**Log output:**
```text
WARN Invalid saturation scaling config entry, skipping key=invalid-config error=kvCacheThreshold must be between 0 and 1, got 1.50
```

## Integration with Controller

### Caching Architecture

The controller uses an **efficient caching mechanism** with ConfigMap watch for optimal performance:

**Initialization (on controller startup):**

The ConfigMap reconciler watches the `wva-scaling-policy-config` ConfigMap and loads
configuration into the shared `Config` object. On startup, the controller bootstraps the
config cache (see `internal/controller/configmap_bootstrap.go`).

**Reconciliation (zero API calls):**

During the optimization loop, the engine reads config from the in-memory cache:
```go
// In optimize() - reads cached config (no API call)
saturationConfigMap := e.Config.SaturationConfigForNamespace(namespace)

// Resolve per-model config by matching model_id + namespace in each entry
scalingPolicy := config.ResolveScalingPolicy(scalingPolicyConfigMap, modelID, namespace)

// Use saturationConfig for saturation-based scaling decisions
// (thresholds drive the analyzer's saturation detection)
```

### Automatic Cache Updates

The `ConfigMapReconciler` watches the `wva-scaling-policy-config` ConfigMap for changes
(see `internal/controller/configmap_reconciler.go`):

1. **ConfigMap change detected** → Watch event triggered
2. **Cache automatically reloaded** → New configuration parsed and stored in `Config`
3. **Next optimization cycle** picks up the new config automatically

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Before (Without Cache) | After (With Cache) |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Startup | N/A | Single ConfigMap read |
| Per Reconciliation | ConfigMap API call | Memory read only |
| Config Change | Manual pod restart needed | Automatic reload + reconcile |
| Latency Impact | Network round-trip per reconcile | Zero (memory access) |
| Concurrency | Serial API calls | Thread-safe concurrent reads |

**Cache benefits:**
- ✅ **Single read on startup** instead of per-reconciliation
- ✅ **Zero API calls during reconciliation** (cached access)
- ✅ **Event-driven updates** (immediate response to changes)
- ✅ **Thread-safe concurrent access** (RWMutex)
- ✅ **Defensive copying** prevents external modification

## Troubleshooting

### ConfigMap Not Found

**Symptom:** Warning log message
```text
INFO No cluster policy ConfigMap in the policy namespace: no limiters or quotas are in force
```

**Solution:** Deploy the ConfigMap:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/configmap-scaling-policy.yaml
```

### Invalid Configuration Entry

**Symptom:** Warning log message
```text
WARN Invalid saturation scaling config entry, skipping key=my-config error=...
```

**Solution:** Fix the validation error in the ConfigMap entry and reapply.

### Missing Default Entry

**Symptom:** Warning log message
```text
WARN No 'default' entry in saturation scaling ConfigMap, using hardcoded defaults
```

**Solution:** Add a `default` entry to the ConfigMap (keeping the `analyzers:`
section states the analyzer explicitly):
```yaml
data:
  default: |
    analyzers:
      - name: saturation
        score: 1.0
    scaleUpThreshold: 0.85
    scaleDownBoundary: 0.70
    kvCacheThreshold: 0.80
    queueLengthThreshold: 5
```

### Override Not Applied

**Symptom:** Model-specific override is not being used

```yaml
# A per-model override. The key is yours to choose; the body binds it to a model.
data:
  granite-in-prod: |
    model_id: "ibm/granite-13b"
    namespace: "production"
    scaleUpThreshold: 0.75
    scaleDownBoundary: 0.60
```

**Checklist:**
1. Verify the entry sets `model_id` and `namespace` in its **body** (the key is arbitrary). A key like `"ibm/granite-13b#production"` cannot exist — Kubernetes allows only `[-._a-zA-Z0-9]` in a ConfigMap key, which excludes both `/` and `#`
2. Verify `modelID` exactly matches the model the variant serves
3. Verify `namespace` exactly matches the variant's namespace
4. Check controller logs for validation errors
5. Ensure entry passed validation (check for WARN logs)

### Config Changes Not Taking Effect

**Symptom:** Updated ConfigMap but controller still uses old values

**Solution:** The controller watches for ConfigMap changes and automatically reloads. Check:

1. **Verify ConfigMap was updated:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get cm wva-scaling-policy-config -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace> -o yaml
   ```

2. **Check controller logs for reload confirmation:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace> deploy/wva-controller-manager | grep -E "scaling policy|saturation config"
   ```

   Expected logs:
   ```text
   INFO  Updated global scaling policy from ConfigMap  entries=2
   INFO  Effective scaling policy  namespace=... modelID=... scalingPolicy="(default entry)"
   ```

3. **If no logs appear, verify watch is working:**
   - Check controller pod is running: `kubectl get pods -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace>`
   - Check for errors: `kubectl logs -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace> deploy/wva-controller-manager --tail=100`

4. **Manual restart (last resort):**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deploy/wva-controller-manager -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace>
   ```

### Cache Initialization Failed

**Symptom:** Warning on controller startup
```text
WARN Failed to load initial saturation scaling config, will use defaults
```

**Solution:** This is non-fatal. The controller continues with the analyzer's hardcoded defaults. To fix:

1. Deploy the ConfigMap:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deploy/configmap-scaling-policy.yaml
   ```

2. The watch mechanism will automatically reload the cache once ConfigMap is available

3. Verify cache loaded:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n <workload-variant-autoscaler-namespace> deploy/wva-controller-manager | grep "Updated global scaling policy from ConfigMap"
   ```

## Example: Production Setup

**deploy/configmap-scaling-policy.yaml:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1

`Limiters` reuses `QuotaLimiterConfig` (`internal/config/quota_limiter.go`); a
`gpu-inventory` entry carries no quota fields, a `quota` entry uses the full quota
schema. See [ScalingPolicy Schema (Phase 1)](#scalingpolicy-schema-phase-1).

**Methods:**
- `Normalize() error` - Folds each analyzer's `parameters` into the typed fields; call at parse time before `ApplyDefaults()`/`Validate()`
- `ApplyDefaults()` - Fills in zero-valued fields with their defaults and seeds the `Analyzers` list when empty; the scaling band is defaulted only for V2-shaped entries, so a partial override cannot clobber a tuned global during `Merge()`
- `Validate() error` - Validates configuration values (thresholds in range, consistency checks, per-analyzer overrides, analyzer/limiter types)
- `EffectiveType()` (on `AnalyzerScoreConfig`) - Returns `Type`, or `Name` when `Type` is empty

## Architecture Notes

### Caching Implementation Details

The caching mechanism uses the following components:

**Thread Safety:**
- Uses `sync.RWMutex` for concurrent access control
- Multiple reconciliation loops can read cache simultaneously
- Write operations (cache reload) are exclusive

**Defensive Copy:**
- `SaturationConfigForNamespace()` returns a deep copy
- Prevents external code from modifying cached configuration
- Each caller gets an independent copy

**Watch Mechanism:**
- Kubernetes watch on `wva-scaling-policy-config` ConfigMap
- Predicate filters to only relevant ConfigMap events
- Event handler reloads cache and triggers reconciliation

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Controller starts successfully even if ConfigMap missing
- The analyzer uses hardcoded defaults (`scaleUpThreshold: 0.85`, `scaleDownBoundary: 0.70`)
- Automatically loads config once ConfigMap becomes available
