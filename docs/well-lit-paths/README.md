# Well-lit paths

A well-lit path is a recipe for one scenario that is **documented, tested and
benchmarked** — the term is llm-d's, and the bar is theirs. Each page below says
which end-to-end suites and which benchmark scenario back it, by filename, so
you can check the claim rather than take it.

Start from the problem you have.

| If this is your problem | Take this path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replica counts are set by hand, or by a CPU threshold that has nothing to do with serving | [Scale a model on saturation](scale-on-saturation/) | Stable |
| A model sits idle for hours holding accelerators | [Scale to zero, and get back](scale-to-zero/) | Stable |
| Scale-ups are too slow: by the time a replica loads, the spike is over | [Bridge a scale-up with a warm pool](warm-pool-bridge/) | Stable |
| Several models are too large to start on demand, and there are not GPUs for all of them | [Hold several large models on one set of GPUs](retained-pool/) | **Experimental** |
| Autoscaling can ask for more GPUs than the cluster has | [Bound a fleet by real GPUs](bound-by-gpus/) | Stable |
| Several teams share accelerators and each has been promised a number | [Cap what each tenant may take](tenant-gpu-quotas/) | Stable |
| The tenant numbers already live in Kueue, and you do not want a second copy | [Bound tenants by the quotas Kueue already holds](kueue-bounded-quotas/) | **Experimental** |
| Several models share one quota and peak at different times, but the quota goes to whichever scaled first | [Share one GPU quota between models whose peaks do not coincide](utilization-share/) | **Experimental** |
| Interactive and batch workloads need different urgency, without per-model config | [Give classes of workloads different scaling behaviour](workload-classes/) | Stable |
| One model, two accelerator types, and you want the cost-efficient one first | [Serve one model on two accelerator variants](accelerator-variants/) | Stable |
| Prefill and decode have different shapes and you want them scaled apart | [Scale a P/D-disaggregated model](pd-disaggregation/) | **Experimental** |

Everything here assumes the scaling manager is installed and a workload is registered. If it is
not, start at [Install the scaling manager in a namespace](../guides/install-in-namespace/) —
the paths pick up after it.

Everything here also assumes a replica starts as fast as it can. Every ramp on
every path is sized by the queue the running replicas build while the new one
starts, so seconds lost on the way to Ready come back as over-ordered replicas.
The first of those seconds is the image pull: `make prepull IMAGES=<engine image>
NAMESPACE=<ns>` before anything scales. For a large model the next is the
weight read through the shared volume:
[`make weights`](../reference/workload-preparation.md#weights-on-the-nodes-disk)
puts a copy on every accelerator node's disk.
The checklist is in
[Preparing a workload](../reference/workload-preparation.md#the-rest-of-the-start-path);
read it before the path you take. Paths that are benchmarked also point at what
the harness adds to that path.

## How these differ from the guides

A **guide** ([guides/](../guides/)) is the steps: run these commands, in this
order, and check this at the end. A **path** is the decision above the steps —
what the scenario buys you, what it costs, when not to take it, and what
evidence exists that it works. Paths link down into guides; they do not repeat
them.

## What "experimental" means

The recipe may still change shape: the defaults are not settled, or the design
is still moving. Each experimental page says which leg is short.

**Stable** does not mean fully covered by CI. Every page's *How it is tested*
section names its suites and states what is **not** covered, and two stable
paths do carry a gap there — read it before depending on one.
