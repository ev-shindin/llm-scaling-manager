# Two models, anti-phase bursts, warm pool on and off

[← Benchmarking guide](README.md)

A warm pool is insurance: every pool Pod holds its accelerators continuously,
lending or idle, so a pool of *N* lowers your maximum fleet by *N*. The case for
paying that is that **one pool covers many models**. This scenario is the
measurement of that claim, and it is the one warm-pool number this repo has
never taken — every other has been a single model bridging its own scale-up,
where the pool is pure overhead at steady state.

Two models, each with its own EPP and its own ScaledObject behind one gateway,
take bursts that do not coincide. The sum of their demand is flat; each model's
own demand swings. Nothing in the system sees the sum — each model scales on its
own signal — so without a pool both models pay a full cold model load on every
rise, at the same moment the other model is giving capacity back. With a pool,
one Pod bridges whichever model is rising and is handed back in time for the
other.

The run is done with the same traffic once per **arm**, and the arms are
compared on time-to-first-token **and** on accelerator-seconds:

| arm | what it is | the insurance it pays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nopool` | autoscaling alone, each model between 1 and `MAX_REPLICAS` | none — every rise pays a cold model load |
| `pool` | the same, plus a 2-Pod warm pool with both models resident | 2 accelerators held for the whole run |
| `floor` | no pool, each model **held at 2 or more** for the whole run | 2 extra replicas held for the whole run |

`nopool` is the baseline; `pool` is the claim under test; `floor` is what a pool
competes against in practice — over-provisioning — and the question the third
arm answers is which insurance is cheaper for what it buys.

**Every model gets the same ceiling in every arm** — as many replicas as it
asks for, up to what the cluster can place — and the pool sits on top of that.
An earlier version lowered the pool arm's cap by the pool's share so that the
arms would "peak at the same number of accelerators"; that also stopped the
pool arm from ever holding three real replicas *and* a bridge, which is a fleet
nobody would run. The cost of each insurance is not imposed through the cap; it
is **measured**, in accelerator-seconds, and that is the number every arm is
priced on.

## The phases

Default shape — a 2 minute lead-in, then four 8 minute phases separated by 90s
bands where neither model bursts (2310s, 38.5 minutes). Model A (Llama) bursts
to `HIGH_RPS` = 9, model B (Qwen) to `HIGH_RPS_B` = 8 — the two do not have
the same per-replica capacity, see below. Each phase is split at
`RISE_WINDOW` = 240s into the rise stage the report keys on and the remainder:

| phase | window | model A | model B | what it is for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lead-in | 0–120s | 3 rps | 3 rps | both stacks serve before anything is measured, so the first burst is a scale-up and not a first-request penalty |
| 1 | 120–600s | 3 rps | **8 rps** | B rises (rise stage 120–360s). A is idle, and A's replicas are capacity B does not have |
| band | 600–690s | 3 rps | 3 rps | neither model bursting, so the two cannot burst at once when they drain at different speeds |
| 2 | 690–1170s | **9 rps** | 3 rps | A rises (690–930s) while B falls — the swap the pool is supposed to absorb |
| band | 1170–1260s | 3 rps | 3 rps | |
| 3 | 1260–1740s | 3 rps | **8 rps** | B rises again (1260–1500s), with whatever state the first cycle left |
| band | 1740–1830s | 3 rps | 3 rps | |
| 4 | 1830–2310s | **9 rps** | 3 rps | A rises again (1830–2070s) |

The table is derived from the same generator that renders the load, so the
report's windows and these boundaries cannot drift apart: `python3
hack/benchmark/two_model_profile.py --emit schedule` prints the live one.

**Why 8 minutes and not 4.** Scale-down stabilization here is 300s — fast up,
slow down, because under-provisioning costs TTFT irrecoverably while
over-provisioning only costs money. A phase shorter than that means the falling
model still holds every replica it grew right through the rising model's whole
window: the two never actually compete, and the anti-phase premise is not
exercised at all. `preflight` refuses below 420s.

The anti-phase property is **structural**, not written out: the generator builds
B's rate from the opposite level of A's, so no edit can make the two models
burst together while the file still claims they do not.

**The load has to be heavy enough to force a scale-up, and that is not obvious.**
Measured on an H200: one replica of an 8B model absorbed **40 rps** of
1000-token requests without queueing, because `maxNumSeq` defaults to 256 — so
neither arm ever added a replica and there was nothing to compare. The scenario
caps concurrency at `maxNumSeq: 32`, which is a normal production value, and the
defaults below (3 → 9 rps, 1000 input and 500 output tokens) then take each model
from one replica to three and back. Capping concurrency does not bias the
comparison: what a pool bridges is a **model load**, whose cost is fixed by the
weights and the storage, so this changes when a scale-up is triggered, not how
long the new replica takes to arrive — identically in both arms.

**The burst must also be SERVABLE at full scale**, and that is the other half of
the calibration. At 1000-token outputs, 12 rps was above what even three
replicas could deliver: the queue grew without bound, the driver pegged at its
worker cap, and both arms would have measured a permanently overloaded system
— "which one is less broken", not what a bridge is worth. Measured here, one
replica serves ~3.8 rps of 500-token requests and three serve ~11, so 3 → 9 rps
needs a scale-up and is comfortably served once it lands. If you change models,
accelerators or token counts, **re-measure both ends**: the rate that forces a
scale-up, and the rate the fleet can still serve at its ceiling.

Arrivals are a **Poisson process at the phase's rate, open-loop** — issued
whether or not earlier requests have returned. A closed-loop driver cannot
measure this: when the server slows it sends less, so the queue never grows and
TTFT stays flat, which makes a cold scale-up look free.

Change the shape with `PHASE_SECONDS`, `CYCLES`, `LOW_RPS`, `HIGH_RPS`.

### The load generator is the llm-d harness

Load comes from **inference-perf**, the generator llm-d-benchmark itself uses,
run from the `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark` image — one instance per model, as
two containers of one Pod. Three things follow from that, and each was a defect
in the bespoke client it replaced:

- **Token counts are real.** inference-perf tokenizes with each model's own
  tokenizer, so `INPUT_TOKENS` means input tokens for *both* of two different
  models. A generator that counts words is off by whatever the tokenizer does,
  differently per model — in a scenario whose whole point is comparing two.
- **The schedule is data, not control flow.** Each phase becomes inference-perf
  `load.stages` entries, and anti-phase is the two profiles carrying **mirrored
  ladders** over identical boundaries. `two_model_profile.py` renders both from
  one schedule, and writes that schedule next to the results; the report
  refuses two arms whose schedules differ.
- **The driver reports its own queueing.** `load_summary.schedule_delay` is
  inference-perf measuring how late it issued its own arrivals. The report
  refuses an arm whose p95 exceeds `--max-queue-delay` (250 ms), and — since a
  missing measurement would percentile to a passing 0.0 — refuses an arm that
  reports none at all.

The two containers share a **start barrier**: an absolute epoch, `PRELOAD_GRACE`
seconds (default 420) after the Job is created. Each fetches its tokenizer
*before* the barrier, because the two downloads do not take the same time and
the difference would offset the ladders for the whole run. A container that
reaches the barrier late prints `LATE-START` and `run` refuses the arm rather
than reporting a run that was never anti-phase; raise `PRELOAD_GRACE` and rerun.

**Stages run back to back.** `load.interval` is inference-perf's *sleep between
stages* — `if self.stageInterval: await sleep(self.stageInterval)` — not a
metrics interval, which is what the name reads as and what llm-d's own shipped
guide profiles set to `30.0`. At 30 that is thirty seconds of **zero load**
immediately before every rise stage: queues drain and the autoscaler sees an
idle fleet in exactly the seconds before the burst, understating every
scale-up, and 240s of silence inside a 2040s run. It is `0` here, because a
phase boundary is a change of rate, not a pause.

### The two models' bursts must never overlap

That is the whole premise — one pool covers many models *because* their peaks do
not coincide — and it does not hold for free. **A stage ends when its in-flight
requests drain, and the bursting model drains slower**, so the two models do not
cross a boundary at the same instant. Measured on CoreWeave: per-stage drains of
4–16s, and a cumulative divergence that reached **6.1s and changed sign** as the
burst moved from one model to the other.

Every second of that divergence is time when both models are bursting. A pool
asked for two models at once can serve one — so it would be recorded as the pool
failing at exactly the thing this scenario measures, when it is an artefact of
the driver.

So `OVERLAP_SECONDS` (default 90) inserts a band between consecutive bursts
where **both** models sit at the low rate. Two things then hold:

- No stage ever has both models high — checked on what the generator emits with
  no arguments, because a band that appears only when someone passes a flag is
  not a guarantee.
- The report **refuses** a run whose measured drift exceeded the band, computed
  from the generator's own per-stage elapsed time. Below the band, the drift
  lands harmlessly inside it.

The band costs the flat-sum premise `2 × LOW` instead of `LOW + HIGH` for its
duration. That is a *dip* in total demand, not a rise, and scale-down
stabilization is 300s — so at 90s no replica is given back because of it, and
what the fleet does is unchanged.

**Tokenizers are cached on the shared model claim.** Each arm would otherwise
fetch both from the public internet, and a blip there costs the whole arm —
measured: a `CAS Client Error` from the Hugging Face CDN took model A down while
model B fetched fine, and the run was refused after five minutes of preload
grace with both models' accelerators already held. The `hf` volume is
`CACHE_CLAIM` under `subPath: benchmark-tokenizer-cache`, so nothing is written
into the weights tree; with no such claim it falls back to an `emptyDir` and
simply refetches. The fetch itself retries five times with backoff.

`RISE_WINDOW` (default 90) is how much of each phase becomes its own stage, and
must be shorter than `PHASE_SECONDS` — the profile generator refuses otherwise,
because an uncut phase has no rise stage to read.

### The prompts share no prefix

`LOAD_DATA` (default `synthetic`) selects inference-perf's dataset, and it
decides whether a scale-up can be measured at all. `synthetic` slices every
prompt from a random offset into a 5 MB corpus, freshly per request, so no two
requests start alike.

The reason is llm-d's shipped scheduling profile. It weights
`prefix-cache-scorer` highest — 3, against 2 for queue depth and 2 for KV
utilisation — and the scorer's hashes chain from the first token. A replica
that has cached a prompt's opening therefore wins every later request that
shares it, **regardless of its queue**, and a replica that has cached nothing
never receives a request, so it never caches anything, so it never starts
winning. Measured on CoreWeave with the `shared_prefix` dataset (32 groups × 64
prompts, cycled — the suite's own shape): per model, the busiest engine did
**99.0 % and 98.7 %** of the prompt tokens over a whole 36-minute arm, and every
replica the autoscaler added did 0.3–2.0 %. Both arms were one-replica fleets,
and the aggregate hid it — pooled across the two models the busiest engine
showed 48.9 %, which looks like spread. With `synthetic`, an **empty** second
replica took 49.4 % of 9 rps from its first minute (p50 TTFT 58 ms).

The report refuses an arm where, per model, one engine did nearly all the work,
because every TTFT and GPU number from such a run describes a one-replica fleet.
`LOAD_DATA=shared_prefix` with `PREFIX_GROUPS` (default 32) is kept to
reproduce the pin, not to measure with.

One consequence for calibration: with no prefix hits, every request is a full
`INPUT_TOKENS` prefill, so a replica's capacity is lower than a shared-prefix
run would suggest. Two Llama replicas served 9 rps at p50 58 ms under
`synthetic`; if you change the dataset, re-measure both ends of the burst as
described above.

### Every latency is the generator's own, per stage

inference-perf v0.6.1 reports `time_to_first_token` as a **per-stage
distribution**. Its per-request records carry no token timestamps at all —
measured on CoreWeave: 210 records, each with the raw response chunks and no
time on any of them. Nothing can be re-cut into a window after the run.

So **the rise window is a stage**. Every phase after the lead-in is split in two
at `RISE_WINDOW` (default 240s) — an opening sub-stage and the remainder, at the
same rate, so the load is unchanged — and the headline number is read straight
out of `stage_N_lifecycle_metrics.json` for the opening stage of each rise. Both
models are split at the same boundaries, so one stage index means one window for
both, and the opening of a *falling* model's phase comes free as a control.

Two consequences worth knowing before reading a table:

- The report computes no percentiles. It prints the generator's, and refuses an
  arm whose stage files do not cover the whole schedule — a run that stopped
  short did not run the schedule the table would describe.
- `start_time` in the per-request file is a **monotonic** clock (measured:
  `10655087.75`, an uptime), so GPU samples are aligned against the driver's own
  start barrier instead.

**Per-request reporting is off.** That file stores the raw SSE text of every
chunk of every response and reached **1.2 GB for an eleven-minute run**, which
`kubectl cp` (exec+tar) truncated — losing an arm at the collection step after
all its accelerators had been spent. Nothing needs it: it carries no token
timestamps, request counts are in `successes.count`, and the failure breakdown
is in `failures.by_label`, in stage files of 7 KB each. A stored run that has one
is still read.

Results arrive as `stage_N_lifecycle_metrics.json` and
`summary_lifecycle_metrics.json`, one directory per model;
`harness_results.py` converts them to the `requests.jsonl` + `meta.json` pair
the report compares, computing nothing the harness already measured.

### The data path resolves nothing

The load addresses the gateway by **ClusterIP**, not by name. Measured twice on
CoreWeave at only ~10 rps aggregate: **5.7% of requests** died of
`ClientConnectorDNSError: Temporary failure in name resolution`, spread across
the whole run rather than bunched at startup. aiohttp resolves once per
connection, and the cluster default `ndots:5` makes a four-dot service name try
every search domain before the absolute one — four lookups per connection. That
is the driver's own loss, three times the report's client-side threshold, and it
voids the arm.

So: the driver reads the gateway's ClusterIP before the run and puts that in
both profiles, the load Pod runs with `ndots:1`, and if the ClusterIP cannot be
read the fallback is an **absolute** name (trailing dot), never a searched one.
This is safe because the shared HTTPRoute matches on path and declares no
hostnames; if that ever changes, the load has to carry a `Host` header instead.

Each container also sends one real request and waits for a 200 before it reaches
the start barrier — the load Pod's istio sidecar is not ready the instant the app
container starts, and the first seconds of a run would otherwise be the driver
failing to connect.

## What makes the arms comparable

Six ways they can silently stop being, each of which still produces a complete
and plausible table. The tooling enforces every one rather than trusting it:

| | enforced by |
| --- | --- |
| Every model must have the **same ceiling** in every arm. A model capped at 2 in one arm and 3 in another differs in TTFT for a reason that is not the insurance under test. | `run` writes `budget.json` (ceiling, floor, pool size); the report **refuses** an arm whose per-model ceiling differs from nopool's, a `pool` arm with no pool, or a `floor` arm whose floor is no higher than nopool's |
| The fleet must start at the floor. With 300s scale-down stabilization and one arm always running first, the second would start on an already-scaled fleet and pay no cold load at all. | `reset` pins both ScaledObjects at `MIN_REPLICAS`, waits for it, then releases them |
| The pool must be **warm**. A cold pool pays a model load *into* the pool on the first burst, on top of the replica's own — a true measurement of a pool nobody would operate that way. | `warm` pins a copy of each model and waits; `run ARM=pool` re-checks |
| The traffic must be identical. | both arms render the same inference-perf profiles from `SEED`; the report refuses if the seeds or the schedule differ |
| The load must reach **more than one replica**. Capacity that is never routed to cannot affect TTFT, so a run where the router pinned everything to one engine measures a one-replica fleet in every arm. | `run` reads each engine's own prompt-token counter every 60 s for the whole arm and keeps the highest reading, so a replica scaled away mid-run stays in evidence; the report **refuses** if, per model, one engine did nearly all the work |
| The **driver** must not be the queue being measured. | inference-perf reports its own `schedule_delay`; the report refuses above 250 ms at p95, and refuses an arm that reports none |

## What it needs

- **Free accelerators for the peak**: `2 × MAX_REPLICAS × GPUS_PER_REPLICA`,
  plus `POOL_REPLICAS × GPUS_PER_REPLICA` for the pool arm. `preflight` counts
  what is actually *placeable* — free accelerators on schedulable, Ready nodes
  that also have the CPU and memory a replica asks for — and refuses below the
  models' peak, because a run that spends its bursts Pending measures the
  scheduler. Set `MAX_REPLICAS` to as many replicas as the models could ask
  for, not to a cap you want to impose: the ceiling is the same in every arm,
  and the insurance's cost is measured, not capped.
- **One accelerator kind.** A warm copy is only reusable on the accelerator it
  was loaded on. `preflight` refuses if the cluster advertises more than one and
  `ACCELERATOR` is not set — a pool pinned to the wrong product is never
  eligible to lend, and nothing fails: the run completes and reports that the
  pool did nothing.
- **Two models of similar size**, both loadable from the model cache the pool
  mounts (`CACHE_CLAIM`, default `model-pvc`). A pool loads its warm copies
  through the same claim the models use.
- Everything [the warm pool guide](../warm-pool/) needs: the two images, the
  RBAC to patch Pods, the NetworkPolicy.
- **To know who owns Istio.** The standup installs `istio-base` and `istiod` by
  helmfile. On a cluster that already runs Istio by other means that install
  does not merge: it fails on ownership metadata part-way through the standup,
  and the half-built namespace then trips the EPP-reuse guard on the next
  attempt. If the cluster provides Istio, say so in the scenario's `gateway:`
  block and the standup will reuse it:

  ```yaml
      gateway:
        className: istio
        providerNamespace: istio-system
        skipInstall: true
  ```

  `preflight` checks this both ways round, so neither mistake reaches a
  standup.
- **A node with 64 GiB free for the load Pod.** Each loader container is
  limited to 32 GiB, and it is not generous: inference-perf materializes
  synthetic prompts lazily in its worker processes and keeps every one, so
  memory grows for the whole run. Measured, the 9 rps loader was OOMKilled at
  8 GiB thirty-three minutes in — at the start of its fourth rise, with the
  arm's accelerators already spent. The driver now stops the arm the moment a
  loader container dies, but the Job still has to fit.

## Running it

Every step is separate and says what it found. The expensive failures here are
the ones discovered at minute 40 of a 45-minute run.

```bash
export BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE=<your namespace>
```

The models, their stack names and their accelerator budget live in
`hack/benchmark/scenarios/guides/two-model-warm-pool.yaml`. `MODEL_A`/`MODEL_B`
and `STACK_A`/`STACK_B` in the driver must match it; `verify` fails loudly if
they drift.

**1. Preflight — before anything exists.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-preflight
```

Free accelerators against the run's peak, one accelerator kind, the phase length
against scale-down stabilization, and the model cache claim.

**2. Stand up both stacks.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-standup
```

**One** standup, two stacks, one shared gateway. Not two standups: the
single-model guide uses `gateway.className: epponly`, which deploys no Gateway
at all and which the renderer refuses for a multi-stack scenario — so there
would be no shared address to drive.

**3. Verify, before any load.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-verify
```

Exactly one gateway Service, **two** EPP deployments, a ready decode replica per
stack, and a real request answered per model on its own path. A stack that 404s
for one model produces a full run of failures that reads like a pool result.

**4. First arm — no pool.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-reset
make benchmark-two-model-run ARM=nopool
```

Refuses if a pool is present. ~45 minutes at the defaults (7 minutes of preload, 38.5 of load).

**5. Create the pool.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-pool-create
```

Created as a **bridge**, with `--max` equal to `--replicas` so the pool's own
ScaledObject cannot resize it mid-run and move accelerators under the
measurement. An idle pool Pod reports **NotReady on purpose** — that is what
keeps it out of the InferencePool. Do not wait on `readyReplicas`.

**6. Warm it — both models resident, before any load.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-warm
make benchmark-two-model-residency   # what each Pod is actually holding
```

This is the step that decides whether the run means anything. `warm` pins one
copy of each model with `warmPoolCopies: "1"` and then **waits** until both are
resident, by asking each pool Pod's supervisor over loopback — the pool's own
NetworkPolicy admits that port only from the scaling manager controller, deliberately, so a
probe Pod could never reach it.

Pinning matters beyond the first burst: in automatic mode a quiet variant loses
its slot to a busier one, and here each model is the quiet one for half of every
cycle — exactly before its own burst arrives.

**7. Second arm — with the pool.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-reset
make benchmark-two-model-run ARM=pool
```

Refuses if no pool is present and re-checks residency (the pool can lose a copy
between `warm` and `run`). The models keep the same ceiling as in every other
arm; the pool's two accelerators are on top, and show up in the GPU-seconds.

`SKIP_WARM_GATE=1` says explicitly that a cold pool is what you meant to measure.

**8. Third arm — over-provisioned, no pool.** Optional, and the one that
prices the pool against the alternative.

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-pool-delete
make benchmark-two-model-reset
make benchmark-two-model-run ARM=floor
```

Refuses if a pool is present. Sets `minReplicaCount` to `FLOOR_REPLICAS`
(default 2) on both ScaledObjects — a Deployment scaled by hand would not hold,
because at the low rate the controller recommends 1 and KEDA puts it back —
waits for both models to be at the floor, then drives the same load. The next
`reset` puts the floor back to 1, so it cannot leak into another arm.

**9. Report.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-report
```

Compares every arm that ran against `nopool`, and when both `pool` and
`floor` ran, prices the two insurances against each other. Beside the results
it writes `report.md`, `report.json` (every number in the tables) and three
SVG plots — p95/p50 per rise window, GPU-seconds per arm, and the fleet
timeline — from the standard library alone, so they can be regenerated on any
machine with `hack/benchmark/two_model_plots.py --json report.json --out .`.

**10. Tear down — it is a shared cluster.**

```bash
make benchmark-two-model-teardown
make benchmark-two-model-status      # confirm nothing still holds an accelerator
```

## Reading the result

A complete three-arm run, with its tables and plots, is on the well-lit path:
[What a warm pool buys, measured](../../well-lit-paths/warm-pool-bridge/measured.md).

**TTFT over the whole run** is the least interesting. Most of a run is steady
state, where the pool does nothing but hold accelerators.

**TTFT per rise** — the first `RISE_WINDOW` (240s) after a model's rate goes up — is where a
bridge can matter. It is printed **one row per rise**, not pooled, because each
rise is a *single scale-up event*: the hundreds of requests inside it are not
independent samples, and pooling them yields a number that looks like n=700 and
carries the weight of n=1.

**Accelerator-seconds, including the pool's own.** A pool arm that wins on TTFT
while holding extra accelerators has not won; it has spent. Note this excludes
the pool's warm-up, which happens before the run — so it *understates* the cost.

**Failures are counted beside every percentile.** A request that did not deliver
all the tokens it asked for is a failure, not a fast success: counting torn
streams as successes lets a saturating arm shed its worst requests while its p95
improves.

The report **refuses** rather than tabulating when the arms are not comparable:
different schedule or seed, unissued arrivals (the driver, not the cluster, was
the limit), driver queueing above 250 ms at p95, or a pool arm that was allowed
more accelerators.

**How far this goes.** Four scale-up events per arm, one run each, no repetition
and no confidence interval. A difference of the same order as the spread between
the two rises of the same model is not a result. To claim a direction, repeat
the pair and check the sign is stable.

## What it does not measure

- **Throughput and ITL.** The output length is pinned (`ignore_eos`), so decode
  work per request is constant by construction; this run is about the arrival of
  capacity, not the quality of it.
- **A-versus-B.** The two models have different tokenizers, so the same prompt
  string is not the same number of tokens for each. Comparing arms is valid;
  comparing model A against model B is not.
- **In-phase bursts.** Both models spiking together is a capacity question, not
  a sharing one, and the pool's answer there is simply "a pool of two lends
  twice".
- **More than one pool.** One accelerator kind, one pool. See
  [several pools](../warm-pool/multi-pool.md).
