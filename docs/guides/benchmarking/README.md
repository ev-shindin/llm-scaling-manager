# Benchmark the scaling manager

## Overview

Stands up an llm-d stack with the scaling manager on a GPU cluster, drives load through it with
[llm-d-benchmark](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-benchmark), and reports latency,
replica counts and cost per run.

Use it to compare scaling behaviour across configurations — thresholds, limiters,
one variant against two. It needs real GPUs; for correctness work without them,
see [Test the scaling manager against a full llm-d stack](../testing-with-llm-d/).

## Prerequisites

A GPU cluster, the namespace and image to measure, and the benchmark CLI:

<!-- guide:env.static.target start -->
```bash
export BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE=<namespace>
export IMG=<your build>
```
<!-- guide:env.static.target end -->

<!-- guide:prerequisites.cli start -->
```bash
make benchmark-install
```
<!-- guide:prerequisites.cli end -->

### If the namespace runs Fast Model Actuation

Benchmarking an FMA namespace works, and standup warns you about the one trap
that matters: this stack renders a PodMonitor named `vllm-<model>`, the same name
the FMA guide uses, so a scenario without `fma.enabled` **overwrites the
FMA-aware one and the launchers stop being scraped, silently**. Most of the
traffic then goes unmeasured — which is how a variant once sat flat at one
replica through a 155-deep queue.

Two things follow for the numbers you get:

- `BENCHMARK_KEDA_MAX_REPLICAS` is a starting value, not the ceiling. Discovery
  caps an FMA variant at the **launcher pods present**, because only one instance
  per launcher is reachable today. Raising the variable past that buys nothing —
  the extra requester pods sit `Pending` and, counting toward anticipated supply,
  suppress the scale-up they were meant to provide.
- The launcher pool does not grow with the benchmark. It is a declared count per
  matching node, so load does not expand it.

Both are explained in [the FMA post-mortem](../../proposals/fma-post-mortem.md).

## Installation Instructions

Already have the scaling manager installed and just want to see it scale? `make benchmark-smoke
NAMESPACE=<ns>` drives symmetric 1024/1024 load at 15 req/s for five minutes
and snapshots the
dashboard, with no standup and no scenario. Everything below is for runs whose
numbers you intend to compare.

### 1. Stand up the stack

<!-- guide:deploy.standup start -->
```bash
make benchmark-standup BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE=${BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE} IMG=${IMG}
```
<!-- guide:deploy.standup end -->

Stands up the model servers via llm-d-benchmark, then installs the scaling manager from this
repo and registers the workloads.

**The model cache has to be ReadWriteMany.** The two the scaling manager scenarios in this repo
ask for it explicitly; `guides/epp-keda-saturation` — which
`BENCHMARK_DIRECT_KEDA=true` selects — comes from llm-d-benchmark and does not,
so on that path check the `Model cache:` line the standup prints. It matters more here than anywhere else: an RWO cache stands the
stack up perfectly — one replica, one node, everything green — and then the
first scale-up leaves the new pod Pending on a volume it cannot attach, so the
run measures an autoscaler that appears not to work. A cluster's *default*
StorageClass is often RWO block storage (kind's `standard` is), so this is the
common case, not the exotic one. The standup prints what the cluster actually
bound and warns if it is not shareable:

```text
Model cache:
  <claim>  <size>  [ReadWriteMany]  Bound  class=<your-rwx-class>
```

Re-running in the **same namespace** reuses that claim and its contents, which
is the fast path: the weights are fetched once and every later run and replica
reads them locally. A fresh namespace means a fresh claim and a full download —
tens of GB for a 32B — so keep the namespace when you intend to compare runs.

**The standup also patches those model servers to drain on scale-down, which
restarts them, and waits for the rollout.** A replica removed mid-stream takes its open
responses with it, and each scale-down produces a burst of client-side stream
failures beginning when the replica goes and ending roughly a generation later.
Those failures land in the same TTFT percentiles and error counts the run exists
to measure, so a comparison between two scaling policies would partly be
measuring which one removed more pods.
Patching is safe here because the standup deployed these workloads itself; it is
pinned to `BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE` and reaches nothing else on the cluster.
`BENCHMARK_DRAIN_ROLLOUT_TIMEOUT` (default 900s) bounds the wait.
`make benchmark-add-variant` does the same for the variant it adds.

**It also moves the timeline you are measuring, so say so in the writeup.** The
hook is a `sleep 45` under a 120s grace period, which means a replica now lingers
for the drain window after KEDA decides to remove it. Scale-down latency and the
replica-count timeline both shift by roughly that much, so a run taken before
this change and one taken after are not directly comparable — compare runs on
the same side of it.

One cosmetic consequence: `benchmark-deploy-wva` writes the ScaledObject plan
*before* the patch is applied, so the plan you see reports
`vllm declares no preStop hook` for workloads that have one thirty seconds
later.

prometheus-adapter is deliberately not installed: it and KEDA both claim the `external.metrics.k8s.io` APIService, of
which a cluster has one.

To keep llm-d-benchmark from installing it anyway, the standup creates the
`prometheus-adapter-resource-reader` ClusterRole that its "is prometheus-adapter
already here?" probe looks for. That object is cluster-scoped and unsuffixed, so
on a shared cluster it may already belong to a **real** prometheus-adapter
release: when it does, and that release lives in another namespace, the standup
leaves it alone and says so rather than rewriting its Helm ownership — which
would break that release's next `helm upgrade`.

## Verification

### Run a workload

<!-- guide:verify.run start -->
```bash
make benchmark-run BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE=${BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE}
```
<!-- guide:verify.run end -->

<!-- guide:verify.report start -->
```bash
make benchmark-report
```
<!-- guide:verify.report end -->

Restart the controller between runs — `make benchmark-restart-controller` —
or learned per-replica capacity from the previous run carries into the next.
The fleet-shape memo lives in the controller pod, so a run that ends on one
request shape leaves the next run opening on what looks like a shape change,
and its first minutes are measured through a hold. Changing the image digest
restarts the controller as a side effect, which is why this only bites when two
runs share a build.

### Check the router spreads load before trusting a latency number

A fleet can scale correctly and still serve almost everything from one replica.
The scorer that places a request on the least busy endpoint
(`active-request-scorer`, or `queue-scorer` on a non-disaggregated profile) is
weighted **below** `prefix-cache-scorer` in the EPP configs shipped here —
`deploy/lib/epp-optimized-baseline.values.yaml` gives prefix-cache 3 against 2
for both — and on a workload with no shared prefix the prefix scorer contributes
no signal while still outranking the ones that do.

Measured on this benchmark: nine decode replicas Ready, **one** serving, 766
requests queued in the router, and the engine-side latency metric reporting
0.04 s because the waiting happened where it cannot see. Raising the spreading
scorer above the prefix scorer took it to nine of nine serving, engine queues to
zero, and the phase-2 fleet from a median of nine replicas to three for the same
load.

Two checks, both cheap, both before the run matters:

```bash
# 1. Is the prefix scorer earning its weight? 0.000 means it is not.
#    Both should be > 0 on a workload with shared prefixes.
curl -sG "$PROM/api/v1/query" --data-urlencode \
  'query=sum(rate(llm_d_epp_prefix_indexer_hit_ratio_sum[5m]))/sum(rate(llm_d_epp_prefix_indexer_hit_ratio_count[5m]))'

# 2. Under load, how many replicas are actually serving?
#    serving/ready well below 1 means the router is concentrating.
curl -sG "$PROM/api/v1/query" --data-urlencode 'query=vllm:num_requests_running'
```

If the hit ratio is zero and `serving/ready` is low, reweight the profile before
reading any latency figure from the run — and prefer the harness's own
`analysis/summary.txt`, whose TTFT is measured at the client and therefore
includes the router wait that `vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds` omits. See
"Judge the ramp on the client's TTFT" in
[analyzer-evidence](../../developer-guide/analyzer-evidence.md).

`make benchmark-report` renders a markdown table from the newest results in the
workspace. A run worth keeping has, per scenario: a non-zero request count, an
error count of **0**, and a replica timeline that moves — a variant flat at one
replica through a deep queue means the scaling manager never saw the load, not that it decided
not to scale. Check the queue-depth column against the replica column before
trusting any latency number; if the two disagree, see
[After the install](../../reference/operations.md) before re-running.

## Cleanup

<!-- guide:cleanup.teardown start -->
```bash
make benchmark-teardown BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE=${BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE}
```
<!-- guide:cleanup.teardown end -->

Removes the scaling manager first, then the llm-d releases: a namespace-scoped install still
creates cluster-scoped RBAC, which deleting the namespace would leave behind.

## Configuration

Optional, except `BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE`.

| Parameter | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE` | — (required) | `my-bench` |
| `IMG` | a build of this branch | `ghcr.io/you/wva:dev` |
| `BENCHMARK_SPEC` | `guides/workload-autoscaling` | `guides/epp-keda-saturation` |
| `BENCHMARK_HARNESS` | `guidellm` | `inference-perf` |
| `BENCHMARK_WORKLOAD` | `prefill_heavy` | `flat_8k1000_10rps_12m` |
| `MODEL_ID` | `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` | `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` |
| `BENCHMARK_REPO_REF` | `v0.7.8` | `main` |
| `BENCHMARK_IMAGE_TAG` | the value of `BENCHMARK_REPO_REF` | `nightly` |
| `BENCHMARK_HARNESS_RUN_AS_USER` | `0` | `1000` |
| `BENCHMARK_KEDA_SCALE_UP_PERIOD` | `5` | `15` |
| `BENCHMARK_KEDA_SCALE_UP_STABILIZATION` | `0` | `60` |
| `BENCHMARK_KEDA_SCALE_DOWN_PERIOD` | `120` | `60` |
| `BENCHMARK_KEDA_SCALE_DOWN_STABILIZATION` | `300` | `120` |
| `BENCHMARK_ALLOW_EPP_REUSE` | `false` | `true` |
| `BENCHMARK_WVA_DEPLOY` | `true` | `false` |
| `BENCHMARK_PREPULL` | `true` | `false` |
| `BENCHMARK_PREPULL_IMAGES` | the engine image the harness pins | `ghcr.io/you/engine:tag` |
| `PREPULL_NODE_SELECTOR` | *(empty: every node with a known GPU product label)* | `example.com/accelerator=h200` |
| `PREPULL_TOLERATIONS` | *(empty: `nvidia.com/gpu` only)* | `dedicated,example.com/pool` |
| `BENCHMARK_MODEL_HOSTPATH` | *(empty: the shared volume)* | `/mnt/local/wva-weights` |

**The harness image must match `BENCHMARK_REPO_REF`.** The harness pod always
runs the checkout's scripts — they are copied in from a ConfigMap built from the
tree — while the image comes from llm-d-benchmark's `defaults.yaml`, which pins
`v0.7.0` regardless of ref. Mixing them fails at the first treatment, e.g.
v0.7.8's scripts call `guidellm run` and the v0.7.0 image's guidellm only has
`benchmark`: `Error: No such command 'run'`. `BENCHMARK_IMAGE_TAG` follows the
ref for you; set it only to pin something else.

### Standing up beside something that already exists

A standup renders a whole stack and applies it unconditionally. On a shared
cluster that is a way to break someone else's running workload without either of
you seeing an error: the pods keep running and answering while the scrape config,
pool membership or image change underneath them. Three refusals now guard that,
each because it happened.

- **An EPP already serving in the namespace.** The guide renders its own EPP
  Deployment, Service, InferencePool and a PodMonitor named `vllm-<model>`, and
  replaces whatever is there. Standup stops, lists the deployments it found, and
  offers three ways on: use a clean namespace, benchmark what is already there
  with `make benchmark-run` alone, or re-render deliberately with
  `BENCHMARK_ALLOW_EPP_REUSE=true`.
- **A controller already running.** The guard used to exclude our own
  deployment name, so a standup silently re-applied over a running controller and
  moved it to `$(IMG)` — including one somebody else was mid-experiment on.
  Standup now prints the running image against the incoming one and points at
  `BENCHMARK_WVA_DEPLOY=false`, which reuses the controller that is already
  installed instead of redeploying it.
- **The `prometheus-adapter-resource-reader` ClusterRole.** Cluster-scoped, so
  taking it over affects every tenant: rewriting its Helm ownership metadata
  makes the real release's next `helm upgrade` fail. Standup previously declined
  only when it carried a release-namespace annotation; it now declines whenever
  the object exists at all, and says so. The probe it exists to satisfy passes on
  the existing object anyway.

The FMA placement check that runs at the top of standup is described in
[the FMA post-mortem](../../proposals/fma-post-mortem.md) — placement, not GPU
alignment, is what decides warm or cold.

**`BENCHMARK_HARNESS_RUN_AS_USER` is 0 because the harness writes to
`/usr/local/bin` at startup.** llm-d-benchmark stopped forcing that UID in
v0.7.8, so on OpenShift the pod gets a namespace UID and dies with
`cp: cannot create regular file ...: Permission denied`. Granting `anyuid` to
its ServiceAccount may not be enough — a cluster SCC with a higher priority can
still win and impose `MustRunAsRange`; asking for UID 0 is what makes that SCC
unable to admit the pod.

**Scaling knobs: the stabilization window is the one that matters.** HPA takes
its most conservative recommendation across that window, so `scaleUp`
stabilization is what delays a scale-up — the `periodSeconds` values are rate
limits, and nothing reacts faster than the HPA control loop's sync period (15s
by default). Scale-up therefore acts on the current recommendation (`0`), while
scale-down waits 300s: removing a replica too eagerly costs a cold start on the
next request, and keeping one too long only costs money.

**The default model is small on purpose.** These runs measure the scaling manager's scaling
behaviour, and a 0.6B model exercises the same path a 32B one does — discovery,
the ScaledObject plan, the scale decision, the report — while pulling far less
and holding one GPU per replica instead of several. Pass
`MODEL_ID=Qwen/Qwen3-32B` when you want the scenario's own model, or
`BENCHMARK_MODEL_ID=` (empty) to defer to whatever the scenario names.

Latency and throughput numbers are model-specific, so a 0.6B run tells you
nothing about a 32B model's TTFT. It tells you whether the scaling manager scaled correctly,
which is what this suite is for.

**`IMG` decides what is measured**, and nothing in the results afterwards says
which binary produced them. The default is a build of this branch rather than a
release: released images reject `--external-scaler-bind-address`, which these
manifests pass, so a run against one measures a CrashLoopBackOff. Set `IMG` to
your own build whenever you have changed controller code.

## Replica start time in the harness

Every ramp a benchmark records is sized by how long a new replica takes to
become Ready ([why](../../reference/workload-preparation.md#the-rest-of-the-start-path)).
llm-d-benchmark adds steps of its own to that path, and a benchmark that keeps
them measures the harness, not the autoscaler. The scenarios under
`hack/benchmark/scenarios/guides/` handle three of them (package installs,
the startup probe, engine caches); a scenario of your own should copy the
same three blocks. A fourth (the `libcuda` walk) is a harness default that
`patch_harness.sh` changes, so every scenario gets it. Two more are the
cluster's, not the harness's -- the image and, for large models, the
weights on the node -- and the image comes first:

**The image is on every accelerator node before the harness deploys it.** A
replica scheduled to a node without the engine image pulls 10-20 GB before
its container starts -- a minute or more on top of the start path above, and
the one term of it that differs from node to node. `make benchmark-standup` holds the image
the harness pins (`docker.io/vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0` in v0.7.8's
`defaults.yaml`, read from the clone) on every accelerator node before it
deploys anything -- `BENCHMARK_PREPULL=false` skips it,
`BENCHMARK_PREPULL_IMAGES=<image>[,<image>]` overrides it,
`PREPULL_NODE_SELECTOR` narrows the nodes (the default is every node with a
known GPU product label) and `PREPULL_TOLERATIONS` adds taints. The holders
keep pulling while the standup goes on, so before the run:

```bash
make prepull-status NAMESPACE=$BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE      # every accelerator node: present
```

The mechanism (one DaemonSet per image, the image itself asleep, no
accelerator requested) is
[Holding the image on the nodes](../../reference/workload-preparation.md#holding-the-image-on-the-nodes);
it applies to any workload the scaling manager scales, not only a benchmark. The scenarios
pull the engine `IfNotPresent` for the same reason -- a pinned tag pulled
`Always` still asks the registry at every start.

**The weights can be on every accelerator node's disk before the run.**
`BENCHMARK_MODEL_HOSTPATH=<directory on the node>` makes the standup turn on
the harness's own node-local mode in the scenario copy: `model-pvc` binds
to a static hostPath volume there, a DaemonSet downloads the model onto
every accelerator node (the placement `make prepull` uses; `PREPULL_NODE_SELECTOR`
narrows it), and the engines deploy only once every node holds it --
`patch_harness.sh` fix 11 gives that DaemonSet a readiness probe on the
completion marker, since the harness's wait reads `numberReady` and a
container with no probe is Ready the moment it starts, and skips its SELinux
relabel only on a node without SELinux (where `chcon` fails, and under the
downloader's `set -e` that ended the script before the marker -- every
downloader crash-looped, re-downloading on each restart); any other `chcon`
error still fails the download. The download Job is
skipped. The benchmark uses the harness's downloader, not `make weights`,
because the harness owns `model-pvc`'s name and the engine's `pvc://` uri,
keeps an existing claim, and only its own mode skips the download Job and
holds the engine deploy until every node is Ready; `make weights` beside it
would leave the harness's Job writing a single node's copy. Three things to know: the harness waits for EVERY node the
DaemonSet counts, and a DaemonSet counts a cordoned node and a node under
`DiskPressure` too (its controller tolerates both taints), so a node that
keeps evicting the downloader holds the standup until `daemonSetTimeout`
(3600 s) and then fails it -- a `NoSchedule` taint of your own on that node
takes it out of the count (seen once on a 17-node cluster: one cordoned node
under DiskPressure since the day before, 16/17 for 22 minutes); the standup refuses a namespace whose
`model-pvc` already sits on another storage class -- the harness keeps an
existing claim, and a run that looks like it measured a local read while
reading the shared volume is the wrong measurement -- so use a fresh
namespace or delete the claim; and the harness's downloader is not
`make weights`'s: it mounts the hostPath directly with `seLinuxOptions.type:
spc_t` (Pod Security `privileged`; on OpenShift only the `privileged` SCC
admits a pod-supplied SELinux type -- the `hostmount-anyuid` binding the
harness makes for itself admits nothing it needs, and the harness grants
`privileged` to its own `inference-perf-runner` ServiceAccount in its
admin-prerequisites step, which is why the standup is cluster-admin-only on
OpenShift), it runs with the harness ServiceAccount's token automounted, it
`pip install`s an unpinned `huggingface_hub` from PyPI at every start, and
`hf auth login` writes the token into the container's `/tmp`. Fix 11
labels at level `s0`, since the `spc_t` downloader writes at whatever level
the runtime gave it and the engines read at the project's. On RHCOS the
directory is under `/var` (`BENCHMARK_MODEL_HOSTPATH=/var/mnt/wva-bench`,
with a disk mounted there). None of this has been run on OpenShift yet. `make weights`
(the general form,
[Weights on the node's disk](../../reference/workload-preparation.md#weights-on-the-nodes-disk))
mounts the claim, carries no token, runs the engine image's own library,
and needs only `baseline`. Fix 12 gives the harness's volume a name that
carries the namespace and a `claimRef` into it -- unpatched, the volume is
named `model-pvc-hostpath-pv` cluster-wide with no `claimRef`, so any
namespace's claim asking for the class takes it and a second benchmark
namespace stays Pending forever -- and scopes the teardown's `kubectl
delete pv -l usage=model-cache`, which unpatched removes every such volume
in the cluster whenever any benchmark namespace is torn down. The placement
is `make prepull`'s, `PREPULL_TOLERATIONS` included. Per node:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n $BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE -l component=model-download -o wide   # one per accelerator node, Ready when the download finished
```

For the 0.6B model the runs above use, this changes nothing measurable: the
read is a second. It is for the model sizes where the read through the
shared volume is the start path.

**Package installs at engine start.** The `preprocess` init container
(`set_llmdbench_environment.py`, from the harness image) writes
`/shared-config/llmdbench_env.sh`, which every engine container sources before
`vllm serve`, and it opens with two `apt-get update && apt install` runs:
`iproute2`, for the `ip route`/`ip rule` lines the script emits on a multi-NIC
RDMA node, and `infiniband-diags`, which nothing on the serving path calls. On
a single-NIC node the script has no `ip` commands and both installs are dead
weight -- and mirror speed is why the same standup starts replicas in
different times on different days. The scenarios wrap the init container's
command so it post-processes the script it just wrote: the `infiniband-diags`
block always goes, the `iproute2` block goes unless an `ip route`/`ip rule`
line is present. The generator itself runs from the image, so this cannot be
patched in the clone; it is the scenario's `initContainers[preprocess].command`.

**The startup probe.** The harness default is `initialDelaySeconds 30 /
periodSeconds 30 / failureThreshold 60`. `patch_harness.sh` fix 10 changes the
default to `1 / 5 / 360` (the same 30-minute budget; 1 rather than 0 because
the API server drops a zero and the harness's config validator then fails the
standup on `None`), and the scenarios that spell out their own `probes:` block
carry the same numbers.

**The `libcuda` walk.** The harness's `accelerator.runtimePreamble` -- the
first thing every engine command runs on an NVIDIA node -- is two
`find / -name libcuda.so.1` walks, one per variable it exports, and each
crosses every mount in the pod: the image's 14 GB of site-packages, the model
volume and the engine-cache volume. Measured inside the engine image on this
cluster's NVMe nodes with two near-empty volumes mounted, 0.6-1.0 s per walk;
on a shared model cache holding many models it would be a directory walk over
the network, twice (not measured here). `patch_harness.sh` fix 14 makes the
preamble ask the loader
cache instead (`ldconfig -p`, 2 ms -- it is where the NVIDIA runtime
registers the driver's `libcuda`), and fall back to a walk of `/usr` and
`/opt` on the root filesystem only, for an image whose only copy is a
forward-compat one. A scenario that writes its own preamble instead of
`${accelerator.runtimePreamble}` keeps whatever it wrote.

**Engine caches.** The chart mounts the model PVC read-only at `/model-cache`,
and a second mount of the same claim inherits that (the CSI driver publishes a
claim once per pod), so the scenarios mount the harness's own `workload-pvc`
-- RWX, read-write, created at standup for the results -- at `/engine-cache`
(an `additionalVolumes` entry of type `persistentVolumeClaim` with a
`subPath`), and point `VLLM_CACHE_ROOT`, `FLASHINFER_WORKSPACE_DIR` and
`TRITON_CACHE_DIR` at it through `extraEnvVars`. The preprocess command also
appends a guard to the generated script: each of those directories is tested
for writability where the engine runs, and one that is not writable is unset
so the engine falls back to its default and pays a compile rather than
failing -- vLLM dies on `os.makedirs` otherwise, and a CSI publish that is
retried after a failure has come back read-only on one node of a cluster
while read-write everywhere else. (Two things to know if you edit that
command: Kubernetes rewrites `$$` to `$` and expands `$(NAME)` in a
container's `command`/`args`, so neither may appear in it; and the generator
leaves its script without a trailing newline.)

That fallback is silent and it is the start-time variance: nine bare starts
of the decode pod spec, three per node on three nodes, were repeatable
within 2.5 s on a node and split by node into 51-56 s and 75-81 s, and
the slow nodes were the ones where `workload-pvc` had come up read-only --
every start there compiled from nothing (14.4 s against 2.9 s from the
cache, and 8 s more before the engine). `BENCHMARK_ENGINE_CACHE_HOSTPATH=<dir>`
(defaulting to `BENCHMARK_MODEL_HOSTPATH`, so one directory turns both on)
makes the standup put the caches on the node's disk instead: it runs
`deploy/enginecache.sh apply` with the harness's engine image -- one
`hostPath` volume at `<dir>/engine-cache`, a claim named `engine-cache`, a
DaemonSet that prepares the directory on every accelerator node
([Engine caches on the node's disk](../../reference/workload-preparation.md#engine-caches-on-the-nodes-disk))
-- and `hack/benchmark/engine_cache_claim.sh` repoints every `engine-cache`
volume in the scenario copy at that claim, without the `subPath`. The env
vars and the guard stay as they are. The edit refuses a namespace without a
Bound `engine-cache` claim and fails the standup: engines whose cache
volume never mounts sit in `ContainerCreating` for good. A hostPath is a
bind mount with no storage driver in its path, so no driver publishes it
read-only (the filesystem under it can still go read-only, which is what the
preparer's readiness and the guard are for); the first start on a node
compiles once and every start after it on that node hits. `make
engine-cache-status NAMESPACE=$BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE` lists the nodes. The
cache is one per node, so until every node has started an engine once a
scale-up can land on a cold one (measured: a second replica Ready 96 s
after it was wanted, on a node no engine had used since the switch); the
standup therefore seeds it -- `BENCHMARK_ENGINE_CACHE_SEED` is `auto`,
which copies the harness's own `workload-pvc` `engine-cache` directory (the
caches' shared home before) onto each node when that claim already exists,
a re-standup in a namespace with history; `none` seeds nothing; a
`<claim>[:<subPath>]` seeds from that. On a fresh namespace the claim does
not exist yet at that point and the first start per node compiles, as it
always did.

After a standup, check what was rendered rather than trusting the scenario:

```bash
D=$(kubectl get pods -n $BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE -l llm-d.ai/role=decode -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
# probe timing and cache paths on the engine container
kubectl get pod -n $BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE $D -o jsonpath='{range .spec.containers[?(@.name=="vllm")]}startup {.startupProbe.periodSeconds}s x{.startupProbe.failureThreshold}{"\n"}{range .env[*]}{.name}={.value}{"\n"}{end}{end}' | grep -E 'startup|CACHE|FLASHINFER|TRITON'
# 0 on a single-NIC node; 1 (iproute2) where the script carries routing lines
kubectl exec -n $BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE $D -c vllm -- grep -c apt-get /shared-config/llmdbench_env.sh

## Snapshotting a run

A run's charts live in Prometheus, which ages them out. Capture them while they
are still there:

```bash
hack/benchmark/snapshot.py \
  --namespace ${BENCHMARK_NAMESPACE} \
  --prometheus-url https://thanos-querier-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster>/ \
  --token "$(oc whoami -t)" --insecure \
  --since 30m --out <run-dir>/snapshot
```

That writes `panels.json`: every query in `deploy/grafana/benchmark-dashboard.json`,
run over the window, with its results. It is stdlib-only, so it works in a shell
whose python has no pip — including the one the benchmark venv provides.

Then render the images, offline, through the real dashboard:

```bash
hack/benchmark/snapshot-images/render.sh <run-dir>/snapshot
```

Grafana and its image renderer come up in docker, provisioned with this repo's
own dashboard, and read the snapshot through a shim that speaks the Prometheus
API. The output is one PNG per panel plus the whole dashboard, written to
`<run-dir>/snapshot/<dashboard-slug>/` — a directory per dashboard, because both
dashboards have a panel called "Deployment Replicas" and a flat layout would have
the second render quietly overwrite the first. Because the data is a file, a run
can be re-rendered months later with no cluster at all, and the images cannot
drift from the dashboard — they *are* the dashboard.

Both steps take a dashboard, so the operational one can be captured and rendered
the same way — useful for checking a layout change, since a cluster Grafana
without the image-renderer plugin answers `/render` with "No image renderer
available/installed":

```bash
hack/benchmark/snapshot.py --dashboard deploy/grafana/operational-dashboard.json ...
DASHBOARD=$PWD/deploy/grafana/operational-dashboard.json \
  hack/benchmark/snapshot-images/render.sh <run-dir>/snapshot
```

The dashboard takes a **Namespace** variable, populated from `wva_current_replicas`
so the list follows whichever label the **Namespace label** variable selects. That
variable is for the `wva_*` panels only: those series carry the workload namespace
as `exported_namespace` and the controller's as `namespace`, while engine and EPP
series carry a plain `namespace` and nothing else, so those panels always match on
it. Pick your namespace at the top of the dashboard when viewing it live;
`--namespace` does it for a capture, and the render passes it through.

`make dashboards-check` enforces that split, along with the panel layout — Grafana
repacks overlapping panels on load, so a broken layout still displays and only the
JSON shows it.
