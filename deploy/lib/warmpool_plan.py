"""Group a namespace's ScaledObjects by the pool shape each one would need.

Two models can share a warm pool only if they agree on two things: the
accelerator they demand, and how many devices one replica takes. Neither is
negotiable at run time -- a warm copy is only reusable on the GPU it was loaded
on, and a model needing more devices than a pool Pod holds cannot start in one
however much memory is free. Everything else about a model (its size, its
traffic, its policy) is a tuning question the pool absorbs.

So the plan is: read what each model's scale target actually demands, bucket by
that pair, and say which buckets are already served and which want a pool.

Reads only. Prints a plan; creating anything is `warmpool.sh create`.
