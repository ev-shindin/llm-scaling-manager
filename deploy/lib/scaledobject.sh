# Optional install step: create a default KEDA ScaledObject for each llm-d model
# server, so a fresh install actually autoscales something.
#
# Requires vars: WVA_NS, WVA_DEFAULT_SO, WVA_DEFAULT_SO_NS,
#                WVA_DEFAULT_SO_PLAN, WVA_DEFAULT_SO_MIN, WVA_DEFAULT_SO_MAX.
# Requires funcs: log_info/log_success/log_warning/log_error, wva_install_scope.
#
# Why this exists: a ScaledObject is not decoration, it is the REGISTRATION. WVA
# has no watch and no listing — it learns which workloads it manages from the KEDA
# calls it receives. So an install with no ScaledObject anywhere is a controller
# that will never be asked about anything, sitting idle and looking healthy.
#
# It is built as plan-then-apply rather than one shot, because creating autoscaling
# objects across a cluster is not something to discover the shape of afterwards.
# The plan is a YAML file that carries its own documentation: every field it
# accepts is explained in the comments it is written with, so editing it needs
# nothing open next to it. It was a TSV, and a table has nowhere to say what a
# column means or which values a column accepts — so the file could only be edited
# by someone who had already read the docs, and the docs had to repeat it all.
#
# The same file is the interchange for the interactive path and the scripted one,
# so there is no capability that needs a terminal — which matters, because these
# install scripts are otherwise non-interactive and CI depends on that. It is
# printed as a table as well: YAML is what you edit, a table is what you read.
#
# WVA_DEFAULT_SO:
#   false (default)  do nothing
#   plan             discover, print the table, write the plan, STOP
#   edit             plan, open $EDITOR, confirm, apply     (needs a terminal)
#   true             discover and apply it all, no questions
# WVA_DEFAULT_SO_PLAN=<file>
#   With an existing file: skip discovery and apply exactly that, edits included.
#   Otherwise: where the generated plan is written (default: a temp file).
# WVA_DEFAULT_SO_NS: a namespace, "wva" for WVA's own, or "all" for every namespace
#   holding model servers. Defaults to what this install can reach: "all" when
#   cluster-scoped, its own namespace when namespace-scoped.

#
# Commented lines are never read back. Anything informational is written as a
# comment for exactly that reason: editing it would change what you were told,
# not what gets applied. Each entry's `apply:` line carries the values that entry
# actually accepts — `adopt` only appears where there is something to adopt.
#
# apply          Required. One of:
#                  yes    create a ScaledObject for this workload
#                  no     leave the workload alone
#                  adopt  it already has a ScaledObject — repoint that one at WVA
#                         instead of adding a second. Two ScaledObjects on one
#                         target is two HPAs writing the same replica count.
#                         Offered only for workloads that have one.
#
# modelID        Required. What the container serves: --served-model-name, or
#                --model where there is no served name. It is also the grouping
#                key — entries sharing a modelID are sized against each other, so
#                a wrong one mis-scales both of them.
#
# minReplicas    The bounds KEDA holds this workload between; WVA decides within
# maxReplicas    them. Defaults 1 and 10. minReplicas: 0 parks the workload when
#                idle and costs its next request a cold start. maxReplicas is the
#                only ceiling on this workload unless a GPU limiter is configured.
#
# variantCost    The relative price of one replica of this variant. Only the ratio
#                between variants of the same model matters, so with one variant
#                per model it changes nothing and 10.0 is as good as any number.
#                Where a model has two, this is what makes WVA prefer one: give
#                the cheaper variant the smaller cost.
#
# scalingPolicy  Optional, and commented out because absent is the right value for
#                most installs. It names a reusable TIER — "interactive",
#                "standard", "batch" — defined in the scaling-policy ConfigMap,
#                whose thresholds this variant scales under. Leave it out and the
#                cluster's own default applies, which an admin can change for
#                every workload at once; name one here and this workload stops
#                following that. A name no tier matches falls back to the default
#                silently, so an entry naming one is a claim that can go stale.
#
# namespace      Where the workload is; with kind and name, what the ScaledObject
# kind           will target.
# name
#
# The comments each entry carries:
#
#   scaledObject   the ScaledObject already scaling this workload, if any. Its
#                  name is what `apply: adopt` would repoint.
#   inferencePool  the EPP queue this workload sits behind, resolved by matching
#                  pod labels against each pool's selector — the same way WVA
#                  resolves it. "(none)" means no pool selects these pods.
#
# After the plan entries there is a second section, `warmPools:`. It groups the
# workloads above by what a warm pool would have to provide and suggests one per
# group; applying an entry there creates that pool. Everything in it is written
# `apply: "no"`, because a pool holds its accelerators from the moment it exists.

# Fast Model Actuation splits a model server across two pods: a REQUESTER
# Deployment that carries the llm-d identity, and LAUNCHER pods -- owned by a
# LauncherConfig -- that hold the GPU and run vLLM. The dual-pods controller
# pairs them, stamping the serving labels onto whichever launcher is currently
# bound (the requester grows a dual-pods.llm-d.ai/dual label naming it).
#
# The launchers really do serve. Measured on pokprod001 during a benchmark, one
# launcher ran at 143 requests running, 61 waiting, KV cache 99.9% full, while
# the decode pod took a fraction of the traffic: at peak EPP dispatched 27.4
# req/s across nine launchers against 5.9 req/s to the decode pod, so roughly
# 82% of the load landed where WVA cannot see it.
#
# WVA cannot use any of it. A launcher pod's ownerReferences lead to a
# LauncherConfig, not to a Deployment or LWS under a ScaledObject, so the walk in
# CollectReplicaMetrics ends without a scale target and the pod is skipped --
# counted in wva_pod_mapping_miss_total, and otherwise silent. Point a
# ScaledObject at the requester and the controller says so every cycle:
#
#   has 1 ready pod(s) but none attributed
#
# That is the durable limitation: an FMA variant has no workload WVA can both
# scale and measure. The requester can be scaled but reports nothing; the
# launchers report everything but belong to no scale target.
#
# Scraping is a second, independent failure, and it is easy to cause by accident.
# A launcher declares no container ports and serves metrics on :8000 (the decode
# pod uses :8200), so a PodMonitor that selects its endpoint by port NAME
# resolves nothing and generates no target at all -- not a failing target, no
# target. llm-d-benchmark gets this right when a scenario sets `fma.enabled`: it
# renders the endpoint with a relabeling that forces __address__ to <podIP>:8000.
# But that PodMonitor is named vllm-<model>, and a later standup of a NON-FMA
# guide into the same namespace renders the same name with `port: metrics` and
# overwrites it. The FMA stack keeps serving; its metrics just stop being
# collected. That is what happened on pokprod001 -- an FMA guide at 09:25Z, a
# workload-autoscaling guide over the top at 09:26Z, and from then on `up{}`
# listed the decode pod, EPP and WVA, and no launcher.
#
# Consequence for anyone reading a plan: in a namespace where FMA is present, WVA
# measures only the decode Deployment, and the GPUs behind the launchers are
# counted nowhere. See docs/reference/operations.md, "FMA launcher pods".
#
# The requester is not found by SO_SERVING_MARKER: it carries the hyphenated

# so_resolve_env_ref answers a so_model_id result that is itself an unexpanded
# variable reference -- $MODEL_NAME, ${MODEL_NAME}, or Kubernetes' own
# $(MODEL_NAME) -- rather than a model name. Some guides -- pd-disaggregation
# among them -- write the engine container's customCommand as a shell script
# that references $MODEL_NAME rather than the literal model name; Kubernetes
# stores that script as-is, so $MODEL_NAME only becomes "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B" when
# bash runs it inside the container, and so_model_id, reading the pod spec, can
# only ever see the unresolved reference. The container's own env entries are
# NOT script -- .value is already the resolved string -- so a variable
# reference can be answered from there instead of guessed at or left empty.
#
# $(MODEL_NAME) is the same problem one layer down, and not a rarer one: that
# spelling is expanded by the KUBELET rather than by bash, and it is what the
# scenarios that pass the model as a plain args entry write --
# config/scenarios/cicd/kind.yaml and examples/sim.yaml both render
#
#     args: ["--served-model-name", "$(MODEL_NAME)"]
#
# so the running process sees the model while the pod spec, which is all this
# reads, keeps the literal. It is answered from the same env list.
#
# $2 is the engine container's env as NAME=value pairs, space-joined (see the
# so_discover query, where it is read off the same container $c that args came
# from -- and note the missing apostrophe there: hack/check-quoted-programs
# reads a comment line naming jq with an odd apostrophe count as the line that
# OPENS a quoted program). A token that is not a variable reference is echoed
# back unchanged. A reference naming an env var this container does not set
# produces EMPTY, not the raw "$VARNAME" text: that text is never a valid
# modelID (no metric series is ever named after a shell variable), so
# returning it would recreate the same bug under a different spelling. Empty
# joins the caller's existing "model could not be read" handling -- which the
# caller reports as an UNRESOLVED REFERENCE rather than as a missing flag, and
# the difference matters: the flag is there in plain sight, it just names a
# variable nothing here answers, and an operator sent looking for a
# --served-model-name that is written on the very next line learns nothing.
#
# Only a token that is ENTIRELY one reference is resolved. A compound one --
# ${BASE}-instruct, /model-cache/$MODEL_PATH -- yields empty deliberately:
# resolving the variable half would produce a plausible-looking modelID that is

#
# THE WEIGHTS HALF IS NEVER APPLIED, only emitted. Three reasons, and the first
# is fatal on its own:
#
#   * A strategic merge cannot REPLACE a volume that already exists under the
#     same name. `volumes` has patchStrategy `merge,retainKeys`, and the
#     retainKeys directive is generated by `kubectl apply`, not by
#     `kubectl patch --type=strategic` -- so the patch merges INTO the existing
#     volume and the API server rejects the whole object:
#         spec.template.spec.volumes[0].persistentVolumeClaim: Forbidden:
#         may not specify more than 1 volume type
#     `model-storage` at `/model-cache` is llm-d's own naming, so an llm-d render
#     with an emptyDir cache -- exactly the layout the weights half exists for --
#     failed every time, and took the DRAIN half down with it, leaving the
#     workload with no hook at all. That is the one outcome this must never
#     produce.
#   * It needs a PersistentVolumeClaim that may not exist, and pods whose claim
#     is missing stay Pending. Size and storage class are cluster decisions.
#   * It changes where an engine reads its weights from. That belongs to whoever
#     owns the chart, not to a command someone ran to fix draining.
#
# The drain half has none of these properties: `containers` merges on `name`, and
# adding a lifecycle hook and a grace period cannot conflict with anything.
# so_workload_weights_safe reports whether the weights half of a document can be
# applied to the live object without destroying it.
#
# The blanket refusal this replaces was right about the danger and wrong to be
# unconditional. `volumes` merges with `retainKeys`, and only `kubectl apply`
# generates that directive -- so `kubectl patch --type=strategic` MERGES into a
# volume of the same name rather than replacing it, and the API server rejects
# the whole object:
#     spec.template.spec.volumes[0].persistentVolumeClaim: Forbidden:
#     may not specify more than 1 volume type
# taking the drain half down with it.
#
# But that only happens when the name is ALREADY TAKEN. A workload with no such
# volume takes the patch cleanly, and that is the workload the weights half is
# for. So the test is the collision, not the operation.

# preparer, and a DaemonSet that happens to share its name is not one.

#
# Only ReadWriteMany claims qualify. A ReadWriteOnce claim binds to one node,
# so proposing it as a shared model cache would produce replicas that cannot
# schedule -- the failure this whole area exists to avoid; and ReadOnlyMany is
# not enough for a path the engine downloads INTO (the jq below says why).

# is which classes are already backing RWX claims somewhere on this cluster.

# here?"), and it is answered from what already works rather than from a table of
# provisioner names that would go stale.

#   driver can; measured, it cost every start on those nodes 25 s), which is

# quiet -- KEDA cannot fetch a metric spec, falls back to CPU, and the HPA reads
# `cpu: <unknown>/80%` while WVA scales nothing -- and the manual remedy was a
# three-step plan/edit/apply dance to change one string.
#
# It repairs only what is provably broken. A candidate must satisfy BOTH:
#
#   1. It already asks for WVA: a trigger whose scalerAddress is
#      wva-external-scaler.<ns>... So an object scaled by prometheus or cpu is
#      never converted -- that is adoption, it is a real decision, and it stays
#      with `scaledobjects-plan` where the operator sees the bounds first.
#   2. The address it names resolves to NOTHING: no external-scaler Service in
#      that namespace.
#
# (2) is the load-bearing one. Two WVA installs on one cluster is a supported
# shape, and a ScaledObject pointing at the other one is correct, not stale --
# repointing it would hijack another team's workload, on a cluster where that is
# exactly the thing not to do. A live Service there means "deliberate", and
# deliberate is left alone and said out loud.
#
# Only scalerAddress is rewritten. modelID, variantCost and scalingPolicy are
# whatever the operator tuned, and a repoint is not the moment to reset them --
# so unlike so_adopt_patch, which replaces `triggers` wholesale because adoption
# must displace a competing scaler, this rewrites the list in place.

    # The asymmetry between scaleUp and scaleDown is the point. Scale-up acts on

    # measured 61s to Ready and the wait is already paid in cold start.

    # removing a replica too eagerly costs that same cold start on the next
    # request, while keeping one too long only costs money.
    #
    # scaleDown used to carry that asymmetry entirely in the stabilization
    # window (300s, matching the API server's own default) plus a full-speed
    # step (Percent 100 -- one step could move the whole way once the window
    # cleared). That combination has a real failure mode: the saturation V2
    # analyzer's own per-request service-time measurement is itself a function
    # of how many replicas currently share the load. A fleet that just caught
    # up reads LOW contention (fast, unqueued service time), which understates

    # value: 50 forces a re-measurement at each intermediate replica count
    # before going further, which is what actually catches the bad case --
    # measured live: a fleet capped at 50%/120s bottomed at half its peak and
    # recovered, where the same trough at 100%/120s went all the way to
    # minReplicaCount and back. Once the per-step rate is doing that work, the
    # stabilization window does not need to carry the whole burden by itself,
    # so it comes down from 300 to 180 -- reacting faster to a genuine drop in
    # demand, since the multi-step descent is now the backstop against a false
    # one rather than the window being the only line of defence.
    #
    # The tradeoff is a slower recovery on a fleet that genuinely does need to
    # go all the way down. The period is a rate limit, not a delay -- and
    # nothing reacts faster than the HPA control loop either, which re-evaluates
    # on kube-controller-manager's sync period (15s by default).

# Idling a WVA-managed workload is not `kubectl scale --replicas=0`: the HPA KEDA
# owns enforces minReplicaCount and puts it straight back. The three obvious moves
# all fail, one of them dangerously:
#
#   kubectl scale --replicas=0     HPA restores minReplicaCount within seconds.
#   maxReplicaCount: 0             not a valid state — KEDA hands it to the HPA as
#                                  the ceiling, and a maximum of zero leaves no
#                                  room to scale up.
#   scale the WVA controller to 0  WORSE THAN NOTHING. KEDA cannot fetch a metric
#                                  spec from a scaler that is gone, so it FALLS
#                                  BACK TO A CPU METRIC and keeps scaling the
#                                  workload between min and max — see
#                                  "cpu: <unknown>/80%" in
#                                  docs/guides/install-in-namespace/README.md.
#                                  The workload keeps its GPUs and is now sized by
#                                  the wrong signal, while everything reads healthy.
#
# The supported lever is on the ScaledObject, and the controller can stay running:
# it holds no GPU and keeping it up keeps the install verifiable.
#
#   park    autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas="<n>"  drives the target to n
#           (0 by default), then freezes the scale loop. KEDA also removes the HPA,
#           so nothing can raise the count while it is parked.
#   freeze  autoscaling.keda.sh/paused="true"          holds whatever is running
#           now. For maintenance, where dropping to zero is not wanted.
#   resume  remove both.
#
# What this is NOT: autonomous idling. `idleReplicaCount: 0` (or minReplicaCount: 0)
# scales to zero when triggers go inactive and wakes on demand — a policy, not an
# operation — and on llm-d it needs the EPP's flowControl feature gate, without
# which it parks and never wakes. Parking is deterministic and needs no gate.

# so_pause_marker is what identifies a ScaledObject as WVA's: a trigger addressing
# the external scaler by name. Matched on the address rather than on
# app.kubernetes.io/managed-by, because an `apply: adopt` object was created by
# something else and carries that label from whatever made it — but its trigger
# names WVA, which is the thing that makes it WVA's to park.
