// Usage basis: which measure of "GPUs in use" a constraint provider must be fed.
//
// There are two, they answer different questions, and feeding one where the
// other belongs is silently wrong — the constraint still computes, it just
// computes an answer to a question nobody asked:
//
//   - a PHYSICAL inventory asks "how many GPUs are actually free on the nodes?"
//     Every GPU-requesting pod counts, whoever owns it, because the scheduler
//     will not place a variant on a device something else already holds. A
//     training job in another namespace is as real an obstacle as one of WVA's
//     own replicas;
//   - a QUOTA asks "how much of the operator's declared allowance has WVA
//     consumed?" A quota governs WVA-managed variants and nothing else. Charging
//     it for pods WVA does not govern exhausts the allowance with workloads the
//     operator never meant to bill against it: a namespace with a 4-GPU WVA quota
//     and an unrelated 4-GPU training job reads as fully spent while WVA has used
//     none of it, and every scale-up is refused.
//
// Providers therefore declare which basis they need, and the caller hands each
// one the matching view (see GPUUsageViews.For). Broadcasting a single figure to
// every provider is what this replaces.
