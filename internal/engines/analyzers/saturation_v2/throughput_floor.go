// The throughput floor: the demand the offered load implies once a replica's
// saturated completion rate (mu) is known, (lambda + backlog / drain) / mu
// replicas per role. The model and its arithmetic are signals/floor (see
// that package's header for the measurements behind it); this file is what
// the saturation analyzer keeps around it -- the window of saturated
// readings per history key, the borrow from a neighbouring bucket, and the
// application of the floor to the demand occupancy measured.

// recordSaturatedThroughput folds one saturated completion-rate reading into
// the window for key. A non-positive rate is not a reading.
//
// The window keeps a MAX, not a mean, and the asymmetry is the point. A
// replica's completion rate while saturated under-reads its capacity while
// the replica is full: in the first minute after it fills, the requests
// completing are the few that were admitted first (a 1m rate on a replica
// that has been full for 20s counts a third of a minute's completions);
// under KV pressure preemption and recompute drop it further. A mean of
// under-reads is an under-read, and the floor divides by it, so an
// under-read mu orders replicas that are not needed. The max of the window
// is the best estimate of what the replica sustains, and a high reading
// errs the way this file already accepts: a floor that is too LOW holds
// back, where occupancy still carries a real shortfall. The exception, and
// it is open, is the drain at the end of an episode -- see below.
//
// A reading counts as a SAMPLE of its own only when it lands
// ThroughputSampleSpacing after the last one that counted and differs from
// it. The rate is rate(...[RequestRateWindow]) evaluated afresh every 15 s
// cycle, so the next cycle reads mostly the same window -- at 30 s scrapes,
// exactly the same two samples, and the same value to the digit -- and one
// saturated moment shows up on several consecutive cycles. Counted each
// time, two cycles cleared MinThroughputSamplesToOrder on the first
// window's under-read: the guard was dead at that scrape interval. Value
// equality alone is not the test either: the rate is an integer count of
// completions over the scrape interval, so two different windows agree to
// the digit a few percent of the time, and two replicas saturating in one
// cycle read two values from the same moment. A minute apart, two readings
// share no samples.
//
// A reading inside the spacing belongs to the last sample's window, and is
// folded into it: the sample becomes the max of what that window read
// (RaiseLast) -- the max the window kept when every cycle was added, no
// more. Dropping in-spacing readings instead lost the highest reading of
// an episode exactly when no next window would come, and on two replayed
// passes left mu 10-12 % low for the rest of the pass, on one of them
// ordering a fourth replica the run never needed. Folding also makes two
// replicas saturating in one cycle read as one moment at the higher of
// the two, whichever row the collector's map yields first.
//
// What the max is worth is another matter. A saturated rate under-reads
// while the replica is full (file header),
// and fails in the last minute of an episode that ends by a replica
// landing: the queue gate is a one-minute max and stays up while the rate
// is fresh, and the fresh rate is the batch draining -- sequences admitted
// together finish together, and no new ones come. Measured on the cold
// pass of 2026-09-19 (second): 6.67 req/s on the last saturated cycle,
// 200 completions in 30 s, with token throughput below the plateau the
// replica held while full (~5.0 req/s sustained), and the window carried
// 6.67 for the rest of the phase. The max window has always taken these;
// nothing in it lowers a reading once taken. The fix is upstream of this
// function -- a reading gated on an instantaneous queue, or a mu priced
// from the generation-token rate over the bucket's output length, which
// does not burst on a drain -- and is open.
//
// A reading equal to the last one given, at or past the spacing, is the
// same scrape pair read again across the boundary (a re-read of the
// previous pair when the next scrape has not landed), or a genuine repeat,
// and only touches; that costs a cycle or two. Compared to the last
// READING, not to the sample, which the fold may have raised above it.
//
// Measured on the shape-swap trace: every saturated rate logged over four
// passes is N/30 (103/30 = 3.43, 110/30 = 3.67, 165/30 = 5.5 ...) but a
// fresh replica's first, extrapolated window, and on the first cold pass
// of 2026-09-19 one decode replica's 3.43 stood on four consecutive cycles
// -- two scrape pairs -- and let the floor order on it. The 35 minutes of
// a third replica that followed were the under-read itself, which
// occupancy would have ordered 30 s later and the floor then held either
// way; the sample count is what this fixes, not that.

// existed because the queue was charged to BOTH roles -- prefill got the input
// tokens and decode got the same input tokens plus the output -- while the
// model total carried the queue once. The per-role demands therefore summed to
// the total PLUS one input-token charge, and moving the total by each role's
// full delta took out tokens it had never held, driving it below zero whenever
// both roles' demand fell.
//
// estimateSchedulerQueueDemand now charges each half of a queued request to the
// role that serves it: the prompt to prefill, the generation to decode. The
// per-role charges are disjoint slices of the same total, so they sum to it and
// a role's full delta is exactly what the total held for that role. The
// correction is not merely unnecessary, it would be wrong -- it would subtract
// a share the total now genuinely carries.
//
// PRE-floor `measured` is still the right thing to subtract, and that part has
// not changed: it comes from aggregateRoleDemand as DemandByRole plus the
// queue's per-role charge, while the post-floor `want` is an independent
// (lambda + backlog / drain) x P / mu with no queue term at all.
// offeredArrivalRate is the model-level arrival rate: the scheduler's, or the
// completion rate of the replicas that generate output when the scheduler
// reports none.
//
// The EPP is the only source of a model-level arrival rate. Without it, fall
// back to what the engines completed: at steady state a queue that is neither
// growing nor shrinking makes completion rate equal arrival rate. That
// equality fails exactly when a queue is building, and completions are then
// capped by capacity -- so this understates lambda precisely when demand is
// highest. Tolerable because a building queue is the case OCCUPANCY reads
// well, so the floor is not what carries that decision.
