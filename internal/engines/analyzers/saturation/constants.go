	// saturated for prefill's sake (Analyze, roleSaturated). It is the
	// collector's row window: every row is a max_over_time[1m], so a prefill
	// row can carry a reading taken up to a minute before the cycle, and
	// decode's rows can have moved on -- measured on the shape-swap P/D
	// benchmark, decode's occupancy had dropped under k1 on the fourth
	// cycle of an episode while prefill's row still repeated the saturated
	// reading to the token. Without the memory that row would have
	// recorded.

	// ShapeChangeHoldMax is how long the fleet is withheld from release
	// after its shape changes, when nothing settles the hold sooner.

	// The hold normally ends the moment a replica reads a throughput window
	// of its own under the new shape (settleFleetShape). A fleet that is
	// over-provisioned for the new shape never saturates, so it never records
	// one: on run biran-20260921-235843-225 the second phase ran 8-21
	// requests across 11 replicas with nothing queued, and an unbounded hold
	// would have pinned all 11 for its remaining 16 minutes. Five minutes is
	// longer than a 6000-token generation plus the rate window that would
	// record it (~60 s + 60 s on that run, the longest shape in the benchmark
	// set), so it does not cut short a fleet that is about to measure itself,
	// and short enough that a fleet that never will is released while the
	// phase is still running.
	ShapeChangeHoldMax = 5 * time.Minute

	// DefaultExpectedOutputTokens is the last-resort generation length used to
	// price a queued request when the fleet has measured none, recalled none,
	// and the operator has configured none (config.ScalingPolicy's
	// ExpectedOutputTokens states the precedence).
	//
	// 512 is a generic chat-completion length and is deliberately modest: this
	// constant exists so the arithmetic is not zero, not so that it is right.
	// A deployment whose generations are materially longer -- the shape-swap
	// benchmark's phase 1 is 6000 tokens, 12x this -- must set
	// defaultOutputTokens, because pricing a queue at a twelfth of its real

	// completion rate a saturated replica sustains falls roughly with output
	// length, so a 1000-token and a 4000-token shape sharing one bucket share
	// one throughput window, and the max the window keeps is the shorter
	// shape's -- which then holds a fleet at the shorter shape's size while
	// the longer one is served. Measured on the shape-swap benchmark
	// (docs/proposals/backlog-sizing.md), where the two shared "long".
	//
	// The boundaries deliberately avoid the round numbers benchmarks use as
	// fixed output lengths (1000, 2000, 4000): a mean that sits on a boundary
	// would move between two buckets on measurement noise and split its
	// history in half.

	// window -- at 30 s scrapes, exactly the same two samples -- and a
	// reading a minute later is from a window that shares none of them.
	// Readings inside the spacing are folded into the last sample (its
	// window is still being read; the sample is the max of it). Equal to the

// floor.MinThroughputSamplesToOrder in useDerived. There was no cycle, and two
// independent 2s that must stay equal is how they stop being equal.
