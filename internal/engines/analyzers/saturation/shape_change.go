// The fleet's shape is (I, O): the prompt length arriving and the generation
// length in flight. Every capacity figure this analyzer learns is keyed by a
// shape bucket, and each is a reading of the shape the fleet was serving when
// it was taken. When the shape moves, those figures describe a workload that
// is no longer running -- and this analyzer's only shape input was each
// replica's own average output length over its recent completions, a LAGGING
// signal: a completion ends O x ITL after the request arrived, ~60 s at 6000
// tokens.
//
// Measured on run biran-20260921-235843-225 (1000/6000 -> 8000/1000 at 6
// req/s, 2026-09-21), whose trace switches shape at t = 1100 s = 18.3 min:
//
//	signal                                    first reads the new shape
//	arriving prompt length (this file)        18.7 min  (+22 s)
//	the decode target actually moving         19.8 min  (+1.5 min)
//	saturatedThroughput for the new bucket    19.9 min  (+1.6 min, and wrong)
//
// The arriving prompt length is available within a scrape of the switch
// because it waits for nothing to complete. On that run it read 5838
// bytes/request through phase 1 and 45626 through phase 2 -- a 7.8x step
// against the 8x the trace applies, on the cycle after the switch, with no
// ambiguity anywhere in between.
//
// What the event buys is not the order -- occupancy still orders, and sooner
// than any of these -- but the two errors that come of acting on a figure the
// switch has made stale: ordering on the old shape's mu (the same run asked
// for 142 replicas against 5.68 req/s arriving, on a mu of 0.039928 req/s
// carried over from a bucket the fleet had left), and RELEASING on the old
// shape's occupancy before the new one has been measured.
//
// The detector is signals/shape's Tracker, which the throughput analyzer
// already drives over its own (IL, OL): a fractional tolerance on either axis,
// not a bucket crossing, so it does not inherit the bucket table that item 1
// of the traffic shape-shift proposal removes. This is item 2 of that
// proposal, less the per-role split -- the hold is the fleet's, as the
// proposal states it, and fleetOutputLength is already model-level.
//
// That proposal is not on main yet; it is under review, and the path is left
// out here deliberately so hack/check-doc-links.py does not report a mention
// of a file the tree does not have.

// change. The tracker is not safe for concurrent use; a.mu serialises it.

	// Measured on the rerun of the 1000/6000 -> 8000/1000 trace (2026-09-22,
	// biran-pd, on the build that carries #85): phase 1 generates exactly
	// 6000-token outputs, which is the xxlong/huge boundary, and the fleet's
	// rate-weighted average wobbled either side of it. The whole fleet shares
	// one throughput key since #85, so the wobble moved all of it at once --
	// mu alternated 2.36 and 0.82 req/s cycle to cycle, a 2.9x swing, and the
	// decode target with it, 10 -> 4 -> 10 -> 4 every 30-45 s for the length
	// of the phase. Only KEDA's scale-down stabilization window kept the
	// fleet itself from following. Before #85 the replicas straddled the
	// boundary independently and the median smoothed it; one key per fleet
	// made the edge total, which is the cost of that fix and this is its
	// other half.
	//
	// A tolerance, not hysteresis on the boundary: the tracker already says
	// when the shape has genuinely moved, and any shape that has not moved by
	// DefaultChangeTolerance keeps the key it was learned under, wherever the

// It is NOT on the same scale as servedPromptLength below: BytesPerToken is
// 4 and the run measured ~5.8 bytes per prompt token, so this reads about
// 46 % high -- 1459 tokens for the trace's 1000. The two are therefore each

//
// The scheduler's queue is the early source: the EPP reports the queue's size
// and its bytes, and bytes / size is the prompt length of what has not been

//

// of completions barely moves it. That fallback lags, being an average over
// completed requests; the cycles where the queue is NOT empty are the cycles
// where the shape is moving or the fleet is behind, which is when the lead
// matters.
//
// Note BytesPerToken is 4 and the run measured ~5.8 bytes per prompt token, so
// the queue estimate reads about 45 % high in absolute terms. It is compared

// the completion rate spikes far above anything the replica sustains, the
// queue gate is a one-minute max and is still up while the burst is fresh, and
// the window -- which keeps a max and never lowers a reading -- carries the
// burst for the rest of the phase. throughput_floor.go's own header records
// this as open and names this fix.
//
// Measured on the 2026-09-22 A/B, phase 1 (1000/6000 at 6 req/s). The window
// settled on 1.7 req/s per replica; the fleet sustained 6 req/s across 6.7
// replicas, which is 0.9. Sized on 1.7 the floor asked for 3.5 replicas where
// the shape needs about 8, and the decode queue ran at a mean of 16.2 against
// a threshold of 5 for the whole phase -- sustained saturation. The run before
// it, whose mu alternated across a bucket boundary, happened to substitute
// 0.82 on half its cycles and so kept a large enough fleet by accident; that
// accident is what removing the boundary flip took away.
//
// Generated tokens do not burst on a drain: a replica emits them at the rate
// its batch allows whether or not any sequence happens to finish. Tokens per
// second over the shape's output length is therefore the same figure the
// completion rate is trying to be, measured where it is steady:
