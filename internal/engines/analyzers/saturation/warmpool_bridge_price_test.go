// of them delivers, and the two factors describe different populations.
//
// The readings genuinely differ: the pool runs its engines at a lower
// --gpu-memory-utilization than the workload does, because it fits several
// sleepers in a Pod where a workload replica has the GPU to itself. Measured on
// pokprod 2026-08-31: pool 0.90, workload 0.95.

// One own replica and one bridge is the worst case, and the one used here: a
// two-element median is the average of the two, so the whole gap lands in P.
