// Package gpuusage keeps the cluster's GPU usage picture up to date, independently
// of any scaling engine.
//
// It exists because the picture used to be a by-product of optimization: the
// saturation engine summed its own population each cycle and published that. Two
// things follow from deriving it that way, and both are load-bearing:
//
//   - it only exists once something is already running. The saturation engine
//     returns before publishing when no variant is active, so a fleet parked at
//     zero — the state scale-from-zero exists to serve — produced no picture at
//     all, and the placement check silently degraded to "unknown", which is
//     permissive. Wakes were published onto accelerators nobody had checked;
//   - it could only ever see what WVA manages. GPUs held by other namespaces,
//     system pods, or another autoscaler were invisible, so every pool reported
//     more free capacity than the cluster had.
//
// Discovering usage from the pods actually occupying GPU nodes fixes both at
// once, and does so before the first scaling decision rather than after it.
