// Package warmpool runs the pool: it observes what is resident, asks the policy
// what should happen, and carries that out through the port.
//
// It is driven from two clocks on purpose. Borrows are event-driven, off the
// same decision store the external scaler watches, so a bridge starts when WVA
// DECIDES rather than when KEDA next polls -- the difference between a
// sub-second bridge and one that begins a poll interval late. Everything else --
// refreshing what is resident, handing back finished bridges, admitting and
// growing -- runs on a slower reconcile, because it involves an HTTP fan-out
// across the pool and a model load costs ~35 s.
//
// The pool never tells KEDA anything. It borrows underneath the same decision
// KEDA is about to act on, and the ordinary scale-up proceeds untouched, which
// is what keeps lent capacity out of the metric KEDA reads.

	// A pool with no readable Pod yet, or Pods on nodes that name no single
