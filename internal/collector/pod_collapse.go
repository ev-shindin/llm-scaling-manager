// collapseToPods merges the per-instance rows of each pod into a single row, so
// a domain.ReplicaMetrics is one *scale-target replica* rather than one engine
// instance.
//
// A vLLM pod running data parallelism hosts DP independently-scraped engine
// instances, distinguished by the port in the instance label; the collector keys
// them "pod:port". Everything downstream, though, counts in scale-target units:
// the optimizer's targets, MaxReplicas, GPUsPerReplica, CurrentReplicas and
// PendingReplicas are all pods (or, for LWS, groups). Emitting per-instance rows
// made the analyzers' supply arithmetic disagree with the units its result is
// spent in — a DP=4 variant would have its pod target computed from a per-
// instance capacity. Collapsing here keeps that arithmetic in one unit without
// every consumer having to know a DP factor the cluster never reports.
//
// LWS needs no special handling: worker pods are dropped upstream, so a group's
// leader is already its single row.
//
// Merging is keyed by pod AND MODEL, not by pod alone -- see podModel. A warm
// pool Pod holds several models at once, and summing their capacity into one
// row would credit a variant with cache belonging to a model it is not running.
//
// How each field merges follows from what it measures:
//
//   - Capacities, queue depth and rates are extensive — summed. A pod's KV
//     capacity is the sum of its instances' capacities, and a request served by
//     any instance is a request served by the pod.
//   - Utilization fractions (KvCacheUsage, KvUsageInstant) are recomputed as
//     Σtokens/Σcapacity rather than averaged, so an instance with a larger cache
//     weighs proportionally more. Without capacity to weigh by they fall back to
//     the plain mean.
//   - Request-shape ratios (input/output tokens, ITL, prefix hit rate) are
//     weighted by RequestRate: they describe the average request, so the
//     instance serving more of them should dominate. With no traffic anywhere on
//     the pod they fall back to the plain mean.
//   - Metadata takes the worst freshness and the oldest age across the
//     instances, so a pod is only as trustworthy as its stalest rank.
//
// Input order is preserved by first appearance of each pod. Rows are copied;
// the input slice is not modified.

// podModel is the merge key: one pod's ranks OF ONE MODEL.

// The pod alone is not enough, and the case that breaks it is the warm pool. An
// ordinary Pod belongs to exactly one variant, so its rows can only be DP ranks
// of the same engine. A POOL Pod holds several models at once -- that is what a
// warm set is -- each on its own port, and the collector keys instances
// "pod:port", so they arrive as several rows for one Pod.
//
// Merging those would sum the KV capacity of unrelated models. On a lent Pod
// every row carries the variant it is lent to, so the sleepers' cache would be
// added to the awake model's supply: the variant is told it has more capacity
// than the engine serving it has, which is the direction that causes a
// scale-DOWN the fleet cannot then serve.
