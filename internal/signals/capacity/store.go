		// over-estimate of per-replica capacity, and an over-stated capacity
		// UNDER-orders replicas, which this project has on record as breaking
		// TTFT irrecoverably.

		// to withhold the NEW thing it would authorise, never to change a path
		// that already existed. IsCapacityCompatible was always a heuristic
		// over parsed fields, and an unresolved value defaulted before this
		// work just as it does now -- recording the gap made the uncertainty
		// visible, it did not create it. So the completeness gate lives only
		// where it gates something new: engineFingerprint, where refusing
		// means a variant learns its own ITL line, which is exactly the
