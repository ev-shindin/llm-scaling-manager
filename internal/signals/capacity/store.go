// IsStale returns true if the record for the given variant is older than
// StalenessTimeout, or if no record exists. No caller on the reconcile path
// today, and that is deliberate: the read paths have no trust horizon.
//
// StalenessTimeout is 30 minutes and EvictionTimeout is seven days, so the
// store keeps a record 336x longer than this function would call fresh.
//
// The reason to keep serving an old record is NOT that the figure is clamped.
// A record's commonest use on the read path is rec.EngineParams, which feeds
// estimateCapacityFromParams -- the DERIVED k2, the figure the rest of this
// change calls the one that raises capacity. So a stale record there pushes
// capacity UP, the opposite of the k2-history argument, which does not
// transfer to this package. Two further paths set capacity from a record with
// no bound from any current k1 at all:
//
//   - the saturation analyzer's computeReplicaCapacityFallback, taken when
//     vllm:cache_config_info is absent. There is no live k1 on that path at
//     all; the record IS the capacity, scaled by KvCacheThreshold, and is
//     written back out as a synthetic TotalKvCapacityTokens.
//   - estimateStoredCapacity's live branch, on the zero-replica path, which
//     returns rec.EffectiveCapacity directly. That figure was min(k1, k2) when
//     it was written, on the hardware it was written on -- not against
//     anything current -- and LoadFromScaleTarget refuses to overwrite a live
//     record, so a redeploy onto a smaller cache does not correct it.
//
// The real reason is what the alternative is. A nil record on the zero-replica
// path falls to lookupCompatibleCapacity and then to perReplicaCapacity = 0,
// which the optimizer skips: the variant stops being scaled at all. An old
// figure is a worse estimate than a fresh one and a far better one than none,
// and scale-from-zero is exactly where no record exists to be fresh.
//
// Kept rather than deleted because an explicit staleness predicate is the
// right thing to have the day a caller wants one -- a diagnostic, or a
// condition on the CR -- and because what it means is now written down. An
// earlier version of this comment reached the same conclusion from two
// premises that were both false.
