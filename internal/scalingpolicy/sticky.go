// Package scalingpolicy is what happens between a plan and an order.
//
// The optimizer says how many replicas the load implies; these are the rules
// that decide what is actually published: a scale-down held against the
// chatter of a fleet that is still settling, the reasons a model may not be
// scaled to zero, whether a cluster-wide inventory read is worth its cost,
// and the throttling of the policy lines an operator reads. Each is a
// function of its inputs, with no engine state behind it, so each can be
// read and tested on its own. It is the scaling pipeline's policy; the warm
// pool has its own, in internal/warmpool/policy.

// manual scale-up during the outage would be undone by the HPA when its
// window closed. The age is the last deciding cycle's (the engine's

// outage: past it the no-decision path publishes the running count as it
// always did, so an operator who scaled the fleet by hand while metrics were
// gone finds the HPA's window filled with the running count, not with a held
// value that would undo the change the moment the carry stopped.
//
// The age bound is fixed on purpose, where the hold's follows the optimize
// interval: it is the HPA's window that sets it, not the loop's cadence. So
// the carry is cadence-limited -- it covers floor(4 min / interval) cycles,
// four at the shipped 15 s, one at 4 min, none above that -- and a loop
// slower than the window cannot be carried through a gap at all. That is

// otherwise leave ~20 distinct events per descent. The numbers go in the
// pipeline step and the log line.
const stickyReason = "held the published scale-down: the fresh target crept back up while utilization at the published count stays under the scale-up threshold"

// HoldPublishedScaleDown keeps a scale-down that WVA has already published
// from being cancelled by demand noise, so the fleet actually descends.
//
// The scale-down rule is stateless: every cycle, from scratch, the target is
// the smallest replica count whose utilization stays under the scale-down
// boundary (0.7 by default). Nothing in that asks what WVA said LAST cycle.
// When demand sits near the boundary -- a model idling at a few requests per
// second, whose per-cycle demand moves 15 % either way -- the target flips
// between N and N-1 from one cycle to the next. KEDA's HPA then takes the
// maximum of the published values over its stabilization window (300 s), so
// one "N" in any 300 s keeps the N-th replica for good: the fleet never gets
// to N-1, the scale-UP threshold (0.85) never gets to judge N-1, and the
// hysteresis the two thresholds are meant to give never engages.
//
// Measured on the two-model benchmark, both runs: a model at 3 rps on two
// replicas published 1,2,1,2,... every 15-45 s for a 900 s quiet band
// (demand 18.8k-23.9k tokens against a boundary of 0.7 x 28 482 = 19 937),
// and held its second replica for the whole band -- 1 GPU x ~3000 s -- in
// the arm meant to show what autoscaling alone costs.
//
// The hold: while the count last published is below the count the target is
// running (a descent is in flight) and the fresh target has crept back above
// it, keep publishing the lower count unless the demand at THAT count would
// reach the scale-up threshold. That is the same hysteresis the two
// thresholds already express, applied to the published value instead of the
// running one -- the published value is what KEDA acts on. A fresh target
// that is lower still is taken as is (the descent continues), and a fresh
// target the demand justifies at the published count wins outright, so a
// burst arriving mid-descent is not held down: at 0.85 of the published
// count's capacity the hold releases and the fresh target stands.
//
// ONE-SIDED ON PURPOSE. The up direction already has its stickiness, from
// the actuator: KEDA's HPA acts on a scale-up at its next sync (its scale-up
// stabilization window is 0) and treats a published value that has dipped
// back as a scale-DOWN request, which enters the same 300 s max-window the
// higher value is still in -- so a target that chatters N, N+1, N, ... goes
// to N+1 once and stays, and the measured runs show exactly that (3, 4, 3,
// 4 during a burst; the fleet went to 4 once). The down direction is the one
// where the published value falls through, because there the window IS the
// stickiness and the chatter defeats it. A direct actuator with no window
// behind it would need the mirror of this hold -- keep a published N+1 until
// demand at N+1 drops under the scale-down boundary -- and that is the
// release test with the other threshold, to be added behind the same switch
// when such an actuator exists and can be measured.
//
// What it cannot survive: the published value lives in memory, so a
// controller restart forgets it, and the safety net that runs while the
// engine has nothing to say publishes the previous desired from the
// variant's status when there is one and the current count when there is
// not -- a restart mid-descent therefore re-arms KEDA's window once. That is
// the pre-existing behaviour on that path, and one window per restart is
// what it costs. A no-decision CYCLE (a scrape gap, a skipped model) does
// not have that effect: CarryPublished republishes the held value there.
//
// On by default (WVA_STICKY_SCALE_DOWN); the switch exists to turn it off for
// a comparison, since off is the behaviour this replaces.
