// ChangeReporter reports which named policy tier each model resolved to, and
// the two ways that resolution goes wrong silently.
//
// Layered configuration is undebuggable without a "which value won" readout, and
// two of the ways it goes wrong are silent by construction:
//
//   - a policy name that resolves to nothing falls back to the default entry, so a
//     typo produces a working-looking configuration that quietly ignores the tier;
//   - variants of one model resolving to DIFFERENT tiers leaves the optimizer
//     distributing replicas across them under conflicting thresholds. WVA scales
//     the model, not the variant, so there is one right answer per model and this
//     is a configuration error rather than a merge to perform.
//
// Both are reported once per change rather than once per cycle: the optimize loop
// runs every 15s and a condition that persists for a day would otherwise produce
// 5,760 identical lines, which is how a real signal becomes noise.
//
// Safe for concurrent use: the reporter holds its own lock.

// ReportUnresolvedAccelerator warns that a variant's accelerator could not be

// This is a LOG line as well as a Kubernetes event. It was written when the event
// did not arrive at all: variants are synthesized in memory and their kind is not
// registered in the scheme, so the recorder could not build an object reference
// for one ("no kind is registered for the type variant.VariantAutoscaling"), and a
// single e2e run attempted 31 of these warnings for which the API server received
// none. That is fixed — events hang on the ScaledObject now, see
// variant.EventTarget — so the two are complementary rather than one standing
// in for the other. They fail in opposite directions: the event is re-emitted while
// the condition holds and the API server aggregates the repeats, whereas this line
// is printed once per change (p.changed, below) and can scroll out of a long-lived
// controller's log. The event is the durable signal; a grep of the log corroborates
// it and cannot clear it.
//
// The consequence depends on whether a limiter is declared, and the difference is
// severe enough to be worth saying rather than leaving to be inferred:
//
//   - no limiter: the variant still scales. Its GPUs are charged to no accelerator
//     pool, so budgets over-state free capacity (wva_unattributed_gpus), and
//     accelerator-keyed metrics are withheld;
//   - a limiter declared: a GPU-aware optimizer allocates out of per-accelerator
//     pools, so this variant is charged to none, receives no budget, and NEVER
//     SCALES UP. Nothing errors; it simply sits at its current replica count.
//
// Reported once per change per variant, so a persistent misconfiguration does not
// print every cycle.
