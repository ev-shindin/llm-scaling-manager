// Trigger metadata keys. These are the whole per-variant configuration surface:

// every RPC, so a value put there reaches WVA without WVA reading anything.

// successor and needs none — KEDA only calls a scaler its trigger names, so
// being called is what being managed means.

	// the cluster default entry's defaultPolicy applies, and failing that the
	// default entry alone.
	//
	// The policy is named, not described, precisely so it is reusable: policies
	// carry no model identity, so one tier serves many models and changing the tier
	// changes all of them at once. That is what per-(model, namespace) config keys
	// cannot express — they bind settings to identity, so a fleet-wide change is an
	// edit per model.

	// It rides trigger metadata because the trigger is already the registration:
	// selecting by policy name needs nothing watched, listed, or matched, unlike
	// resolving policy from an InferencePool's selector.

	// WarmPoolKey names the warm pool this variant may borrow from, when the
	// namespace holds more than one. Optional, and deliberately NOT boilerplate:
	// a namespace with a single pool needs no selection at all, because there is
	// nothing to disambiguate. Writing a pool name on every ScaledObject would
	// be ceremony in the case that is by far the most common.
	//
	// More than one pool is a real configuration rather than a hypothetical: a
	// warm copy is only reusable on the accelerator it was loaded on, so a
	// cluster with two GPU types needs a pool per type, and a tensor-parallel
	// variant needs Pods holding that many devices.
	//
	// When a namespace holds several pools and a variant names none, it gets no
	// warm copy and WVA says so. Picking one for it would be a guess with a cost:
	// the wrong pool means a ~35 s load that can never serve.
	WarmPoolKey = "warmPool"

	// WarmPoolCopiesKey is how many warm copies of this variant the pool should
	// hold. Optional; a non-negative integer.
	//
	// Absent means AUTOMATIC, which is the default and the right answer for
	// almost everything: the pool decides from parking, popularity and miss
	// frequency, and holds at most one copy. Setting it takes that judgement
	// away, and is worth doing in two cases automatic mode cannot express.
	//
	//	"0"  never warm this variant -- it opts out of a pool it shares, freeing
	//	     the slot for models that gain more from it
	//	"1"  always keep one warm, whatever the pool's own ranking thinks
	//	"N"  keep N warm, so N scale-ups of this variant can bridge AT ONCE
	//
	// The last is the one automatic mode cannot do at all. A single warm copy
	// bridges a single scale-up, so a variant that scales twice in quick
	// succession takes a cold start for the second with free Pods sitting
	// beside it. It is also the only way to weight a shared pool toward one
	// model, since automatic mode holds one copy of each and no more.
	//
	// "1" is not the same as absent. Absent lets a quiet variant lose its slot
	// to a busier one; "1" pins it, which is what a low-traffic but
	// latency-critical model needs and what popularity ranking can never give.

	//
	// A pool is scaled the same way every other workload here is -- WVA computes
	// a size, KEDA writes it -- which is what lets the controller stay read-only.
	// The alternative was a write permission on the pool Deployment, and
	// internal/controller/rbac.go is explicit that a licence to resize workloads
	// is the single permission a cluster admin is most right to refuse.
	//
	// Its presence is also what excuses this trigger from carrying a modelID: a
	// pool serves no model in particular, and every consumer that builds
	// variants skips these entries rather than inventing one.

	// the figure decides how much backlog a scale-up is sized for. A 0.6B model

	// with a cold JIT cache -- which is too wide a range for any built-in
	// default to serve both.
	//
	// It is a SEED, not a setting: the first replica observed starting replaces
	// it with a measurement, and wva_replica_start_seconds_estimate carries a
	// source label saying which is in force.
	//
	// Nothing reads it yet, deliberately. The only path from here to the
	// analyzer runs through the synthetic VariantAutoscaling that
	// utils.VariantsFromRegistry builds, and that CR is being removed -- adding
	// a spec field to it would be dead on arrival. The key is declared now
	// because it is the operator-facing contract the proposal commits to, and it

	// DefaultOutputTokensKey seeds how many tokens one request of this model
	// generates.
	//
	// The demand floor prices a request waiting in the router queue at the

	// that many tokens of work, and that is what makes a growing queue worth
	// ordering capacity for. Until a replica has COMPLETED a generation there is
	// no reading to price it with, and a queue priced at zero does not order:
	// measured on the shape-swap benchmark, 141 requests sat in the router queue
	// through a whole phase while decode's share of them was nothing.
	//
	// It is a SEED, not a setting, exactly like replicaStartSeconds: the fleet's
	// own average output length replaces it the moment one exists, so a figure of
	// the right order is what matters and an exact one buys nothing. The built-in
	// fallback is 512 tokens, a generic chat completion -- twelve times short of
	// this benchmark's 6000, which is why the key exists.
	//
	// It rides trigger metadata rather than the scaling-policy ConfigMap because
	// it is a fact about one workload's traffic, not a threshold a class of
	// workloads shares: a fleet-wide generation length is already what the
	// built-in fallback is. Optional; a non-negative whole number.
	//
	// A model's variants may each carry one -- there is a ScaledObject per role
	// under P/D -- and they are resolved to one figure for the model, because the
	// queue being priced is the model's. The LARGEST wins and a disagreement is
