"""
Self-test for the two-model anti-phase scenario: the schedule, the arrival plan,
the rise windows, the report's arithmetic and every one of its refusals --
executed rather than read.

It exists because each claim this scenario makes rests on a small function
nobody looks at twice, and every one of them fails SILENTLY:

  * `build_schedule` putting both models on the high rate in one phase still
    completes and still prints a table -- describing an IN-PHASE run as an
    anti-phase one, the opposite of the thing being measured.
  * `plan_arrivals` drawing from one shared stream gives the two ARMS different
    traffic under an identical --seed, which is the one thing an A/B must not do.
  * `rise_windows` marking the wrong phases turns the headline number into
    steady-state TTFT under a heading that says rise.
  * `pct` off by one rank inflates both arms, unequally.

Run by hack/check-two-model-scenario.sh; no cluster, no network.
