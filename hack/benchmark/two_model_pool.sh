# Two models, two EPPs, anti-phase bursts, with the warm pool on and off.
#
# THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
# -------------------------
# A warm pool is insurance: every pool Pod holds its accelerators continuously,
# lending or idle, so a pool of N lowers the maximum fleet by N. The case for
# paying that is that ONE pool covers MANY models -- an argument nothing in this
# repo measures. Every warm-pool number taken so far is one model bridging its
# own scale-up, where the pool is pure overhead at steady state and the only
# question is whether the bridge beats the ramp.
#
# With two models whose bursts do not coincide, the pool is shared: it lends to
# whichever model is rising and is handed back in time for the other. One GPU of
# insurance covers two ramps. If that does not show up here, the shared-pool
# argument is wrong and this run is how we find out.
#
# WHY ANTI-PHASE, SPECIFICALLY
# ----------------------------
# Because it isolates the sharing. The SUM of the two models' demand is flat, so
# a cluster that could see the whole picture would hold its total fleet constant
# and move replicas between the models. Nothing does see it -- each model scales
# on its own signal -- so without a pool both models pay a full cold load on
# every rise while the other model is giving capacity back.
#
# FOR THE COMPARISON TO MEAN ANYTHING
# -----------------------------------
# The two arms must differ in ONE thing. Four ways they silently did not, each
# of which produces a complete and plausible table:
#
#   * The arms were allowed different ceilings. Every arm gets MAX_REPLICAS
#     per model and the pool sits on top of that; what the pool costs is
#     measured in accelerator-seconds, not imposed through the cap. `run` sets
#     the ceiling; it does not hope.
#   * The fleet was not reset. With scale-down stabilization at 300s and nopool
#     always first, the second arm starts on an already-scaled fleet and pays no
#     cold load at all. `reset` pins both models back to MIN_REPLICAS, waits for
#     it, and only then releases them.
#   * The pool was COLD. Then the first burst pays a model load INTO the pool on
#     top of the replica's own, and the arm reports the cost of a pool nobody
#     would operate that way. `warm` pins both models resident and waits.
#   * The load differed. Both arms render the SAME inference-perf profiles from
#     the same seed, and the report refuses two arms whose schedules differ.
#
# WHO GENERATES THE LOAD
# ----------------------
# inference-perf, the llm-d benchmark harness's own generator, one instance per
# model, in two containers of one Pod. Not a bespoke client: the harness
# tokenizes with each model's own tokenizer (so `input_tokens` means input
# tokens for both of two different models), expresses the schedule as stages
# (so anti-phase is two mirrored ladders rather than a loop keeping time), and
# reports its OWN scheduling delay -- the quantity that decides whether the
# driver or the cluster produced the latency being compared.
#
# STEP BY STEP, DELIBERATELY. The expensive failures here are the ones found at
# minute 40 of a 45-minute run.
