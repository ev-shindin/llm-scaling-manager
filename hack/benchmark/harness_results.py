harness_results.py -- turn one arm's inference-perf output into the
`requests.jsonl` + `meta.json` pair that two_model_report.py compares.

WHERE EACH NUMBER COMES FROM, and why it is not the obvious place.

inference-perf v0.6.1 writes, per run directory:

  stage_<n>_lifecycle_metrics.json     per stage: load_summary (count,
                                       requested/achieved rate, schedule_delay),
                                       `successes.latency` -- where
                                       `time_to_first_token` lives -- and
                                       `failures.by_label`, the breakdown of
                                       what went wrong
  summary_lifecycle_metrics.json       the same, over the whole run
  per_request_lifecycle_metrics.json   OPTIONAL and off by default: see below

**TTFT is per STAGE, not per request.** The per-request records carry no token
timestamps at all in this version -- measured on CoreWeave: 210 records, every
one with `info.response_metrics.response_chunks` and no time on any chunk. So
latency cannot be re-cut into windows after the fact, and the profile makes the
windows that matter into stages instead. This converter reads the distributions
the harness computed; it does not recompute them from data that is not there.

**The per-request file is not collected.** It stores the raw SSE text of every
chunk of every response, and reached 1.2 GB for an eleven-minute run -- which
`kubectl cp` (exec+tar) truncated, losing an arm at the collection step after
all its accelerators had been spent. The profile turns it off. Everything the
report needs is in the stage files: counts in `successes.count`, and the failure
breakdown in `failures.by_label`. It is still READ when present, so a stored run
from before remains readable.

**start_time, where a per-request file does exist, is a MONOTONIC clock, not
epoch** -- measured: 10655087.75, an uptime. It orders requests and nothing
else. The run's origin on the wall clock comes from `--t0`, the start barrier
the driver handed both containers, and that is what the GPU samples are aligned
against.

The converter refuses rather than emitting a short file when something it needs
is absent: a report built over a truncated conversion looks exactly like a
report built over a run where the cluster dropped the requests.
