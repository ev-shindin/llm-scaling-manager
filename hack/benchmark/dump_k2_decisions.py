                                    cycle

k2-decision, replica-capacity-decision and replica-capacity-store-fallback are
logged at V(logging.DEFAULT), which is the verbosity the shipped deployment
runs at (cmd/main.go defaults -v to logging.DEFAULT). Started with -v=1 or
lower, the controller suppresses them and this report comes back empty.
replica-capacity-skipped is at Info and survives any -v, since it reports a
replica contributing no capacity at all rather than a routine decision.
