"""
two_model_report.py -- compare the arms of the two-model
anti-phase run.

It reports four things, and the last two decide the question.

  1. TTFT over the whole run, per model. Least interesting: most of a run is
     steady state, where a pool does nothing but hold accelerators, so a pool
     that works well shows up here only faintly.
  2. TTFT in each RISE WINDOW, one row per rise rather than pooled. There are
     only two rises per model per arm, and each one is a SINGLE scale-up event:
     the hundreds of requests inside it are not independent samples of anything.
     Pooling them into one percentile produces a number that looks like n=700
     and carries the weight of n=1. Printed separately, with counts, so the
     reader can see how thin the evidence is.

     Every latency here is the LOAD GENERATOR's own per-stage distribution.
     inference-perf v0.6.1 records no per-request token times, so nothing can
     be re-cut into a window after the run -- which is why the profile makes
     each rise window a stage of its own. The report reads what the harness
     measured; it does not recompute it.
  3. Accelerator-seconds, INCLUDING the pool's own. A pool arm that wins on
     TTFT while holding extra accelerators for the whole run has not won; it
     has spent.
  4. Whether the comparison is admissible at all -- same schedule, every
     arrival issued, and the DRIVER's own queueing small enough not to be the
     number being compared.

Refusals rather than a table, where the run cannot support one. The arms are
separated by tens of minutes and an edit in between is easy; a table that
silently compares a 2-cycle run against a 3-cycle one is worse than no table.

    What is NOT normal is a gap that never closes. The run this guard was
    written for stayed short for THIRTY MINUTES.

    A Pod that is Pending holds no accelerator and serves nothing, so an arm
    whose Deployments scaled to 3 while one replica ran is measuring a
    one-replica fleet. Measured on CoreWeave exactly that: KEDA actuated
    correctly within four minutes of the first burst, four Pods went Pending and
    eight by the end, and the arm ran its whole schedule on one replica per
    model. The other arm, an hour later, got everything it asked for. Nothing
    compared the two fleets, so the report would have called the difference a
    warm-pool result.

    `budget.json` establishes what each arm was ALLOWED. This establishes what
    it actually got.
