# The scenario's value is that its two arms differ in ONE thing. Every guard
# here protects that, and each protects it against a mistake that produces a
# complete, plausible, WRONG result rather than an error -- at 34 minutes of GPU
# on a shared cluster per arm:
#
#   * `run pool` with no pool writes a directory labelled `pool` containing the
#     nopool arm, and the report believes the label.
#   * `run nopool` with a pool still holding accelerators does the same in the
#     other direction, charging the pool's GPUs to the arm that exists to show
#     life without one.
#   * `run pool` against a COLD pool measures the first burst paying a model
#     load INTO the pool, and reports it as the pool's cost.
#   * a standup that rendered ONE stack leaves one EPP; the other model 404s for
#     the whole run and the failures read as a result.
#   * two gateway Services, or none, and the driver would pick one and drive
#     every request at a stack that does not serve both models.

# kubectl is stubbed: these are argument-and-state guards, and every one must
# fire before anything is created. A guard that fires after the Job exists has
